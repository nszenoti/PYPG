I would like to share some feedback regarding the course:

1. Clarity in Pre-Enrollment Guidance: Program Counsellors should provide transparent and accurate information instead of making misleading promises to attract students. Clear expectations should be set before enrollment.

2. Consistency in Program Information: Different representatives of the organization have provided varying explanations about the programâ€™s nature, leading to confusion. There should be a singular, well-communicated understanding of the program to ensure consistency.

3. Coverage of Essential Topics: While having a broad curriculum is valuable, fundamental topics should be covered in sufficient depth rather than being merely listed in brochures or on the website. This ensures a solid foundation for students.

4. Program Stability and Uncertainties: The program structure and curriculum should be well-defined and stable, minimizing uncertainties or last-minute changes that might affect the learning experience.

5. Quality of Educators and Course Content: That said, the educators and the content provided so far have been sound and of good quality, which is appreciated.
