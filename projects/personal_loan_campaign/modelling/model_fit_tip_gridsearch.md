Yes, we DO need to fit the final model with the best parameters! Here's why:

1. **What GridSearchCV does**:
   - Tries different parameter combinations
   - Uses cross-validation (splits training data into temporary train/validation sets)
   - Finds best parameters
   - The model it has is fit on only a portion of the training data (last fold of CV)

2. **What we need to do**:
   - Take the best parameters
   - Create a fresh model with these parameters
   - Fit it on the ENTIRE training dataset

Here's the code showing both approaches:

```python:projects/personal_loan_campaign/hw/notebook1.ipynb
# 1. Wrong way (using GridSearchCV's model directly)
best_model_cv = grid_search.best_estimator_
predictions_wrong = best_model_cv.predict(X_test)

# 2. Correct way (creating new model with best params)
best_params = grid_search.best_params_
final_model = DecisionTreeClassifier(**best_params, random_state=SEED)
final_model.fit(X_train, y_train)  # Fit on entire training data
predictions_correct = final_model.predict(X_test)
```


Why this matters:
- The final model should use ALL training data
- GridSearchCV's best model only used a subset of data
- More data generally means better model performance

This is why we always see the pattern:
1. Find best params with GridSearchCV
2. Create new model with those params
3. Fit on full training data
