Let's analyze both approaches hypothetically:

1. **Using both during GridSearchCV**:
```
GridSearchCV(
    DecisionTreeClassifier(class_weight='balanced'),
    scoring='f1_weighted'
)
```
- Pros:
  - Each parameter combination is evaluated with balanced trees
  - Parameter selection considers both class weighting and weighted metric
  - More consistent approach
- Cons:
  - Might be "double-counting" the class imbalance
  - Could lead to over-compensation for minority class

2. **Using f1_weighted first, then balanced tree**:
```
1. Find params with f1_weighted scoring
2. Use params to build balanced tree separately
```
- Pros:
  - Cleaner separation of concerns
  - Parameters selected based on weighted metric first
  - Then apply balancing to final model
- Cons:
  - Parameters chosen might not be optimal for balanced tree
  - Two-step process might lead to suboptimal results
  - Parameters optimal for unbalanced might not work well with balancing

**Recommendation**: Approach 1 (using both during GridSearchCV) is more theoretically sound because:
- Parameters are optimized while considering class weights
- More coherent single-step process
- Better alignment between model training and parameter selection

The second approach feels more like mixing two different strategies that weren't optimized together.
