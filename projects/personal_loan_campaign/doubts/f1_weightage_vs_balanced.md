No, they are different concepts even though both deal with class imbalance:

1. **f1_weighted as scoring**:
   - Used during parameter selection (GridSearchCV)
   - Affects HOW we choose the best parameters
   - Doesn't change the model itself
   - Just weights the evaluation metric

2. **class_weight='balanced'**:
   - Directly modifies the model's training
   - Adjusts how the tree makes splits
   - Actually changes the model structure
   - Weights are inversely proportional to class frequencies

Let's see the difference:

```python:projects/personal_loan_campaign/hw/notebook1.ipynb
# Approach 1: f1_weighted scoring only
grid_search_f1w = GridSearchCV(
    estimator=DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=SEED),
    param_grid=param_grid,
    scoring='f1_weighted',
    cv=5
)

# Approach 2: balanced class weights only
grid_search_balanced = GridSearchCV(
    estimator=DecisionTreeClassifier(class_weight='balanced', random_state=SEED),
    param_grid=param_grid,
    scoring='f1',  # regular f1
    cv=5
)

# Approach 3: Both together
grid_search_both = GridSearchCV(
    estimator=DecisionTreeClassifier(class_weight='balanced', random_state=SEED),
    param_grid=param_grid,
    scoring='f1_weighted',
    cv=5
)

# Fit all approaches
grid_search_f1w.fit(X_train, y_train)
grid_search_balanced.fit(X_train, y_train)
grid_search_both.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Compare results
print("1. f1_weighted scoring results:")
print(classification_report(y_test, grid_search_f1w.predict(X_test)))

print("\n2. balanced class_weight results:")
print(classification_report(y_test, grid_search_balanced.predict(X_test)))

print("\n3. Both combined results:")
print(classification_report(y_test, grid_search_both.predict(X_test)))
```


Key differences:
1. `scoring='f1_weighted'`:
   - Only affects parameter selection
   - Original class distributions maintained in tree
   - Weighted evaluation during CV

2. `class_weight='balanced'`:
   - Modifies the actual tree building
   - Adjusts sample weights during training
   - Changes how splits are chosen

You might use:
- Both together for heavily imbalanced data
- Just class_weight for modifying tree structure
- Just f1_weighted for parameter selection focus

Would you like to analyze how these approaches affect the tree structure or performance differently?
