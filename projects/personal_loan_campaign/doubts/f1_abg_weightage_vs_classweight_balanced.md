Both approaches address **class imbalance**, but they work differently in terms of how they influence model training.

---

### **1. GridSearchCV with `scoring='f1_weighted'`**
- In **GridSearchCV**, when you use `scoring='f1_weighted'`, it evaluates each model using a **weighted average of F1 scores** for each class.
- **Effect:**
  - Gives **higher importance to the majority class**, but still considers the minority class.
  - **Does not change how the model is trained**, just how it is evaluated.

---

### **2. Using `class_weight='balanced'` in Decision Tree**
- When you set `class_weight='balanced'` in **DecisionTreeClassifier**, it **modifies the training process** by assigning higher weights to minority class samples.
- **Effect:**
  - The decision tree will **penalize misclassifications of the minority class more heavily**.
  - Helps the model learn **decision boundaries that donâ€™t completely favor the majority class**.

### **Key Differences**
| Aspect | GridSearchCV (`f1_weighted`) | `class_weight='balanced'` |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Effect on Training** | No effect, just changes how models are evaluated | Affects training by adjusting weights of samples |
| **Bias Toward Majority Class** | Still favors the majority class (but considers minority class) | Reduces bias towards majority class |
| **Impact on Model Selection** | Helps find a model that balances precision & recall | Trains a model that treats classes more equally |
| **Works With Any Estimator?** | Yes (does not modify how training happens) | Only works for models that support `class_weight` |

### **Which One Should You Use?**
- If you **just want to pick the best model** â†’ Use `scoring='f1_weighted'` in GridSearchCV.
- If you **want to modify how the model learns** â†’ Use `class_weight='balanced'` in DecisionTreeClassifier.
- **Best Approach:** Combine both â†’ Use `class_weight='balanced'` **while training**, and use `scoring='f1_weighted'` **to select the best model**.
