Yes! Breaking down Cost Complexity Pruning (CCP) into these steps makes it much clearer:

1. **Step 1: Get Raw Data**
   - Tree structure
   - Misclassification rates for each node/subtree

2. **Step 2: Calculate Alphas**
   ```
   Î± = (Misclass_as_leaf - Misclass_with_splits)/(Num_leaves - 1)
   ```
   - Each subtree gets its own alpha
   - Alpha represents "cost per node" of keeping subtree

3. **Step 3: Use Alpha as Threshold**
   ```
   If subtree_alpha <= ccp_alpha:
       Prune it (too costly to keep)
   Else:
       Keep it (worth the complexity)
   ```

It's like having a "budget" (ccp_alpha):
- If a subtree's "cost per node" (alpha) is less than your budget
- You prune it because it's not worth the complexity

This makes it easier to:
1. Understand why certain subtrees are pruned
2. Control tree complexity with a single parameter
3. Make informed decisions about tree size
