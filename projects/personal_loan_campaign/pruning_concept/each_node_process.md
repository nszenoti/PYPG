Yes, exactly! The alpha values are derived from the misclassification rates. Here's the flow:

1. **What We Have Initially**:
   ```
   For each node/subtree:
   - Misclassification rate as leaf
   - Misclassification rate with splits
   - Number of leaves in subtree
   ```

2. **Then Calculate Alpha**:
   ```
   α = (Misclassification_as_leaf - Misclassification_with_splits)
       --------------------------------------------------------
                    (Number_of_leaves - 1)
   ```

3. **Example**:
   ```
   Node B with children D,E:
   - Misclass_leaf = 0.3 (if B is a leaf)
   - Misclass_split = 0.2 (with D,E splits)
   - Num_leaves = 2

   α = (0.3 - 0.2)/(2-1) = 0.1
   ```

So:
- Misclassification rates are the raw data
- Alpha is derived/dependent value
- Each subtree gets its α value
- These α values determine pruning sequence

The algorithm uses misclassification rates to find the optimal pruning sequence through alpha calculations!
