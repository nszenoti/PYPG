Let me explain ccp_alpha's significance with a concrete example:

Imagine a node in your decision tree:
```
Current Node: 100 samples
- 80 samples say "No Loan"
- 20 samples say "Yes Loan"
- Current Accuracy = 80%

Potential Split:
Left Child:  60 samples (55 No, 5 Yes)  - 91.6% accurate
Right Child: 40 samples (25 No, 15 Yes) - 62.5% accurate
Combined New Accuracy = 81%
```

Now, ccp_alpha comes into play:

1. **Without ccp_alpha (α = 0)**:
   - Improvement = 81% - 80% = 1%
   - No penalty for adding nodes
   - Decision: "Split! Any improvement is good!"

2. **With ccp_alpha (α = 0.02)**:
   - Improvement = 1%
   - Cost = α × (number of new nodes) = 0.02 × 2 = 0.04
   - If Improvement < Cost: Don't split!
   - Decision: "Not worth it! The 1% improvement doesn't justify adding complexity"

Think of it like a business decision:
- Improvement = Additional Revenue
- ccp_alpha = Cost of Opening New Branches
- Only expand if revenue > costs

The higher the ccp_alpha:
- More "expensive" to add nodes
- Tree stays simpler
- Less likely to overfit

This is why it's called "Cost Complexity" Pruning - it adds a cost to complexity!
