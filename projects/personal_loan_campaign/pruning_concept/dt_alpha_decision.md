Yes, exactly! When you provide a specific alpha to the classifier:

```python
# Example
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(ccp_alpha=0.03)
```

The pruning works like this:

1. **During Tree Building**:
   ```
   For each subtree:
   If subtree's_alpha <= provided_ccp_alpha:
       Prune this subtree (make it a leaf)
   Else:
       Keep the subtree
   ```

2. **Example**:
   ```
   Tree with calculated alphas:

         A (α=0.05)
       /          \
    B (α=0.02)    C (α=0.03)
    /        \
D (leaf)    E (leaf)

If ccp_alpha = 0.025:
- D,E: Keep (leaves)
- B: Prune (0.02 ≤ 0.025)
- C: Keep (0.03 > 0.025)
- A: Keep (0.05 > 0.025)
   ```

So:
- Higher ccp_alpha = More pruning
- Lower ccp_alpha = Less pruning
- ccp_alpha acts as a threshold for pruning decisions

That's why it's important to try different alpha values to find the optimal tree size!
