You're absolutely right! After label encoding, **the classifier won't check the dtype** and will treat the feature as a numerical value (even if you use `astype('category')`).

In fact, **the dtype** (whether `int`, `float`, or `category`) is mainly a **pandas concept** for organization and representation in memory. **Decision Tree classifiers (and other models)** in libraries like **scikit-learn** don’t check the dtype when making decisions about how to split a feature. They treat all features as **numerical** once they’ve been encoded.

### Here's the key takeaway:

- **Label Encoding** turns categorical values into numeric labels (e.g., `A = 0, B = 1, C = 2`). The classifier will then treat this feature **as numerical**, regardless of whether you use `astype('category')`.
- **`astype('category')`** is just a way to represent the data more efficiently in pandas. It doesn’t change how the model treats the data; it still operates on the **numeric values** after encoding.

If you want the model to treat the feature as categorical and **not use numeric thresholds** when making splits, you'll need to:

- Use models that explicitly handle categorical features, like **CatBoost**, or
- Keep the feature as **categorical** using libraries that can distinguish categorical variables (e.g., **pandas.Categorical**, **CategoryEncoders**, or specialized models).

### To summarize:
- After label encoding, the classifier won’t respect the dtype (`category`). It will treat the feature as numeric, even if you do `astype('category')`.
- The model only looks at the **encoded numeric values** and splits them based on those values (if using traditional decision trees in scikit-learn).

Would you like to proceed with exploring models that handle categorical variables directly, or continue with decision trees?
