Looking at the log-transformed histogram with KDE, we can identify potential decision tree split points using these principles:

**Split Point Identification:**

1. **Peaks (High Density)**
   - Represent clusters of income groups
   - Tree might split at valleys between these peaks
   - Each peak could represent a distinct income segment

2. **Valleys (Low Density)**
   - Natural separation points between income groups
   - Good candidates for decision tree splits
   - Less likely to split groups with similar behaviors

3. **Looking at our plot:**
   - First valley: Around $40-45K
   - Major peak: Around $70-80K
   - Second valley: Around $110-120K
   - Upper tail: Beyond $150K

The decision tree will likely create splits at these valleys because:
- They represent natural breaks in income distribution
- They separate distinct income groups
- They minimize within-group variance

Would you like me to explain how these splits might relate to loan acceptance patterns?

Ah, excellent question! The log transformation helps us better than the regular histogram in several ways:

**Regular Histogram Limitations:**
1. Higher income ranges ($150K+) get compressed into a long right tail
2. Lower income ranges ($20K-$50K) get squeezed together
3. Natural breaks in lower/middle incomes are harder to see
4. Valleys and peaks in middle-income ranges are obscured

**Log Transform Advantages:**
1. "Stretches out" the compressed areas of original histogram
2. Makes valleys and peaks visible across ALL income ranges
3. Shows natural groupings that were hidden in original scale
4. Gives equal importance to proportional changes
   - e.g., $30K to $60K (2x) looks same as
   - $100K to $200K (2x)

This helps decision trees by:
- Finding meaningful splits in ALL income ranges
- Not overlooking important patterns in lower incomes
- Treating proportional changes consistently

Would you like to see a side-by-side comparison to highlight these differences?
