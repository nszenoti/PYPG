For selecting meaningful feature pairs for multivariate analysis with Decision Trees, here's a strategic approach:

**Recommended Feature Pairs:**

1. **Income & Education**
   - Both likely influence loan decisions
   - Income patterns might differ by education level
   - Natural splitting points for tree

2. **Income & CCAvg**
   - Shows spending capacity vs earnings
   - Both are financial indicators
   - Could reveal customer segments

3. **Age & Mortgage**
   - Life stage vs debt level
   - Could show borrowing patterns
   - Age groups with different mortgage levels

4. **CCAvg & Education**
   - Spending patterns by education
   - Might reveal distinct behaviors
   - Could show financial sophistication

5. **Income & Mortgage**
   - Debt-to-income patterns
   - Key financial relationship
   - Important for loan decisions

6. **Age & Income**
   - Career stage insights
   - Life cycle patterns
   - Natural progression relationship

7. **Family & CCAvg**
   - Household size vs spending
   - Family financial patterns
   - Lifestyle indicators
