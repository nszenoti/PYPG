Suggested Pairs for Bivariate/Trivariate Analysis:

1. Income + Family Size vs Personal Loan
Why this pair?
Income is a numeric variable, and Family size is either numeric or categorical. Both could provide strong splits related to the decision to opt for a loan. High income combined with family size may yield insight into loan eligibility.

2. CCAvg + Income vs Personal Loan
Why this pair?
This pair can reveal interesting patterns between income and credit card spending. Customers with higher income may tend to spend more, and this could influence whether they opt for a personal loan.

3. Education vs Personal Loan
Why this pair?
Education could influence the type of loan a person would opt for. Graduate and professional education may correlate differently with loan choices than undergraduate education. This will be particularly helpful in Decision Trees to identify split points.

4. Mortgage vs Personal Loan
Why this pair?
The presence of a mortgage could indicate financial obligations. The Decision Tree might use this to decide whether a customer is likely to apply for a personal loan based on their existing liabilities.
5. Securities Account vs Personal Loan
Why this pair?
People with a securities account might be more financially sophisticated and have access to other forms of credit, which could influence their decision to apply for a personal loan. This feature could help with distinguishing between loan applicants and non-applicants.
6. Online Banking vs Personal Loan
Why this pair?
Customers who use online banking may have different profiles in terms of loan adoption. This can provide insight into whether tech-savvy individuals are more or less likely to opt for a loan.
7. CCAvg vs Mortgage vs Personal Loan (Trivariate Analysis)
Why this pair?
Combining these features may uncover patterns where people with higher credit card spending or mortgage values may also be more inclined to apply for a personal loan.
