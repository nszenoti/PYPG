# Observations (Income):

- Income distributions are relatively similar across all age quartiles
- Each age group shows the clear separation between loan acceptors and non-acceptors
- The income "sweet spot" for loan acceptance remains consistent across ages

- For all age groups, higher income individuals (>$100k) are more likely to accept loans
- The income threshold for loan acceptance appears fairly consistent across age groups
- Non-acceptors show wider income spread in all age quartiles

- Middle age quartiles show slightly higher income concentrations
- Income variability is relatively consistent across age groups
- No strong age-dependent pattern in loan acceptance rates

- Bimodal distribution visible in most age groups
- Loan acceptors (1) show more compact, concentrated distributions
- Non-acceptors (0) show wider, more spread out distributions

# This reinforces that income is the dominant factor in loan acceptance,
# while age plays a minimal role in the decision-making process
