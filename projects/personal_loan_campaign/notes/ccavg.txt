Here are some quick observations based on the summary statistics for CCAvg (average credit card spending):

Range: The minimum value is 0, while the maximum value is 10. This indicates that the ccavg variable spans from 0 to 10, which suggests there are some customers with no credit card spending at all.

Mean and Median:

The mean is 1.94, while the 50% (median) is 1.50, indicating a slight right-skewness because the mean is higher than the median.
This implies that most customers have low credit card spending, but there are some customers with higher spending (since the mean is above the median).
Standard Deviation: The std is 1.75, indicating that there is a significant spread in the data. Some customers have much higher spending compared to others.

Quartiles:

25% of the customers have ccavg values below 0.70.
75% of the customers have ccavg values below 2.50, showing that the majority have low credit card spending.
Zero Spending: The fact that the minimum is 0 suggests there are customers who don't spend anything on credit cards, which could be an important feature for decision-making.


This indicates a moderate positive skew, meaning more customers have lower credit card spending, but a few have higher values.
