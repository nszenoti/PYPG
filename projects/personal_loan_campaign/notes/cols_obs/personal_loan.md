The imbalanced distribution can cause the Decision Tree to be biased toward predicting the majority class (0).
It's important to monitor recall, precision, and other imbalanced-class metrics to ensure your model captures both classes.
Consider techniques like resampling, class weights, or stratified sampling to help your model handle the imbalance more effectively.
