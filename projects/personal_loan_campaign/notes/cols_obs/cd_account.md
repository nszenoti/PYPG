**CD Account - Story in Numbers:**

1. CD accounts are quite rare in our customer base - only about 6 out of 100 customers (302 out of 5000) have one, making it an exclusive banking product.

2. The huge difference between customers with and without CD accounts (94% vs 6%) shows it's even more selective than securities accounts.

3. These 302 CD account holders might represent a special group of customers with distinct banking preferences and financial behaviors.

4. If there's a strong pattern between having a CD account and accepting loans, this could be a valuable clue for identifying high-potential customers, despite being such a small group.
