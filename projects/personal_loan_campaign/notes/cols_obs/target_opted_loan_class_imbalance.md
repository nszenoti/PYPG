When you have a categorical variable with a **non-uniform distribution**, like:

- **0** → 4520 instances
- **1** → 480 instances

It means that your data is **imbalanced**, with the class **0** being much more frequent than **1**. This can have a few important implications for your **Decision Tree** model:

### 1️⃣ **Class Imbalance Impact on Decision Tree Splits**
- **Decision Trees** try to minimize **impurity** (such as Gini Index or Entropy). In this case, since **0** is much more frequent, the tree will likely focus on **splits that help predict the majority class (0)**.
  - If the tree doesn't handle the imbalance properly, it may **over-predict** the majority class (0) and **under-predict** the minority class (1).
  - This could lead to **poor recall** for class **1**, as the tree may be biased toward predicting **0**.

### 2️⃣ **Overfitting Risk**
- **Decision Trees** are prone to **overfitting**, especially when there's a class imbalance. The tree might create **deep branches** for class **0** (the majority) to get perfect predictions, but struggle to generalize for class **1** (the minority).
  - The result could be a tree that works well on training data but doesn't perform well on unseen data.

### 3️⃣ **Performance Metrics**
- If you're evaluating the model with **accuracy**, the model might seem to perform well just because it predicts **class 0** correctly most of the time.
  - However, **accuracy** is not always the best metric when dealing with imbalanced classes. In this case, **precision** and **recall** for class **1** would be more informative.

### 4️⃣ **Handling Class Imbalance**
To address these challenges, you can try a few strategies to ensure the Decision Tree performs better on the minority class (**1**):

- **Resampling Techniques**:
  - **Oversample the minority class (1)** using techniques like **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or random oversampling.
  - **Undersample the majority class (0)**, though this may lead to losing valuable data.

- **Class Weights**:
  - Assign higher **weights** to the minority class (1). Most Decision Tree implementations (like **Scikit-learn**) allow you to set **class weights** so that the tree puts more emphasis on correctly classifying the minority class.

- **Use Stratified Splits**:
  - When splitting the data into training and testing sets, you can use **stratified sampling** to ensure the class distribution is similar in both sets.

- **Alternative Metrics**:
  - Instead of accuracy, evaluate your model using metrics like **F1-score**, **Precision-Recall AUC**, or **ROC AUC**. These metrics provide a better understanding of how well the model performs across both classes.

### 5️⃣ **Model Tuning**:
- You may need to tune the **max_depth**, **min_samples_split**, or other hyperparameters to **control overfitting**.
- Setting **minimum samples per leaf** to a higher value can prevent the tree from overfitting by forcing it to make splits based on more samples, which helps in dealing with imbalanced data.

### **Summary**:
- The **imbalanced distribution** can cause the Decision Tree to be biased toward predicting the majority class (0).
- It's important to monitor **recall**, **precision**, and other **imbalanced-class metrics** to ensure your model captures both classes.
- Consider techniques like **resampling**, **class weights**, or **stratified sampling** to help your model handle the imbalance more effectively.
