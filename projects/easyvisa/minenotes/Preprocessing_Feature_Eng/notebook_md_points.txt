Outliers
Trees naturally handle outliers by creating separate branches.

The tree structure will naturally adapt to find meaningful year thresholds if they exist, regardless of the distribution shape.

Binning 
Trees handle continuous values well, but bins can help interpretability.
If bins show clear separation in target variable trends, they might be useful.
If the binned feature isn't useful, the model will simply ignore it without degrading performance.
