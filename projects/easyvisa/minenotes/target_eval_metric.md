Prioritizing recall for "Denied" is more crucial because:

1. **Regulatory perspective**: The visa program's purpose is to protect US workers while allowing qualified foreign workers. Missing a case that should be denied (false negative) could undermine this protection.

2. **Cost of errors**: 
   - False positive (predicting Certified when actually Denied): Could allow unqualified applicants through, potentially affecting US labor market
   - False negative (predicting Denied when actually Certified): Delays a qualified applicant, but they can appeal or reapply

3. **Stakeholder impact**: Government agencies would likely prefer to err on the side of caution (higher recall for Denied) to ensure compliance with regulations.

4. **Practical implementation**: A model with high recall for "Denied" ensures suspicious applications get proper human review, while clear approvals can be processed more efficiently.

The consequences of incorrectly approving an application that should be denied are typically more serious than incorrectly flagging an application for review.

It depends on the real-world impact:  

- **If wrongly predicted as Certified (False Negative - FN):**  
  - A **denied** case is misclassified as **certified** → leads to **misinformed** decisions.  
  - This could mean wasted time, effort, and legal issues for applicants/employers.  
  - **More critical in regulatory or legal scenarios.**  

- **If incorrect in identifying actual denials (False Positive - FP):**  
  - A **certified** case is misclassified as **denied** → may cause **unnecessary rejection.**  
  - Potential loss of opportunity but can be re-evaluated.  

**Which is more important?**  
- **FN (Denied misclassified as Certified) is generally riskier** → **Recall for Denied should be the priority.**  
- But if false denials (FP) are also costly, a balanced metric like **F1-score** is useful.
