Wage vs Case Status
---
Very high-paying positions might have a slightly better chance of approval.

1. **Low-wage threshold effect**: There may be a higher scrutiny or denial rate for very low-wage positions, possibly reflecting immigration policies that prioritize higher-skilled workers.

2. **Entry-level position challenges**: This could indicate that entry-level or lower-skilled positions face more challenges in the visa process.

3. **Potential split point for trees**: This separation in the low wage range could be a valuable split point for tree-based models, even if the overall distributions are similar.

4. **Targeted insight**: While prevailing wage might not be strongly predictive across its entire range, it could be particularly informative at the lower end of the spectrum.
