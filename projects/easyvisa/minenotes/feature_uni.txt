- Most visa applications come from mid-sized companies (100-10K employees), with fewer applications from very small or very large organizations.

Year_Of_estab
---
Most visa applications come from companies established in recent decades, with fewer from very old companies.
The data shows that as years progress, more companies in the dataset were established, with a concentration of companies founded in recent decades. This reflects both the general growth in business formation over time and possibly a higher likelihood of newer companies seeking foreign workers through visa applications.

Potential insight: The model might discover that very old companies (e.g., established before 1900) have different approval patterns than modern companies.

- Companies established after 2005 have notably higher approval rates (69.6%) compared to companies from other eras (65-66%).
- Companies established before 2006 show remarkably consistent denial rates (33-35%), suggesting age isn't a major factor among established companies.

**Business insight**: The data suggests newer companies might have advantages in the visa process, possibly due to being in growing industries or having more modern business practices.
