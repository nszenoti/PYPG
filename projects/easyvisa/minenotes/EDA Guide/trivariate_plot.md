Here are the best **MultiVariate Analysis** pairs, considering relevance to the **classification task** and ensuring they provide useful insights for **Ensemble models**:  

---

### **1️⃣ (continent, case_status, has_job_experience)**  
📊 **Plot**: Stacked Bar Chart or Grouped Bar Chart (hue = has_job_experience)  
🔍 **Insight**:  
- Does job experience impact case approval **differently across continents**?  
- Are some continents more **lenient/strict** regardless of experience?  

---

### **2️⃣ (prevailing_wage, case_status, has_job_experience)**  
📊 **Plot**: Box Plot or Violin Plot (hue = has_job_experience)  
🔍 **Insight**:  
- Do **higher wages** correlate with more approvals?  
- How does job experience interact with wage levels for approval rates?  

---

### **3️⃣ (yr_of_estab, case_status, continent)**  
📊 **Plot**: Box Plot or Line Plot (hue = continent)  
🔍 **Insight**:  
- Do older companies have higher approval rates?  
- Is this trend consistent across different continents?  

---

### **4️⃣ (number_of_employees, case_status, prevailing_wage)**  
📊 **Plot**: Scatter Plot or Bubble Plot (size = prevailing_wage)  
🔍 **Insight**:  
- Do larger companies have better approval chances?  
- Is there a wage factor linked to company size influencing approvals?  

---

### **5️⃣ (full_time_position, case_status, continent)**  
📊 **Plot**: Stacked Bar Chart (hue = continent)  
🔍 **Insight**:  
- Does **full-time vs. part-time** impact approval rates?  
- Are part-time positions **less likely to be approved** in specific regions?

Yes, these **5 pairs** are carefully selected to ensure we cover the most **impactful relationships** in the data. They align well with:  

✅ **Key features affecting approvals** (wage, experience, company size, full-time status).  
✅ **Regional variations** (continent-wise trends).  
✅ **Multi-level dependencies** (e.g., experience + wage + approval).  
✅ **Relevance for Ensemble Models**, without unnecessary complexity.  

This should **complete** the **Multivariate Analysis** phase of EDA. 🚀
