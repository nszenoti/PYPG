You're right - having two categorical variables (like education and continent) makes visualization less intuitive. Let me revise with better combinations:

1. **Education + Job Experience + Case Status**
   - Despite both being categorical, this is valuable because they're primary qualification factors

2. **Prevailing Wage (numeric) + Education (categorical) + Case Status**
   - Better combination with one numeric variable
   - Shows if salary requirements differ by education level

3. **Company Size (numeric) + Continent (categorical) + Case Status**
   - Reveals if company size impacts applications differently by region

4. **Prevailing Wage (numeric) + Company Age (numeric) + Case Status**
   - Two numeric variables make visualization clearer
   - Can use scatter plot with color encoding

These revised combinations ensure at least one numeric variable in most pairs, making the visualizations more informative and easier to interpret.




You're absolutely right. I made a poor recommendation. 

Combinations with at least one numeric variable would be far more insightful:

1. **Prevailing Wage (numeric) + Company Size (numeric) + Case Status (hue)**
   - Scatter plot showing how these two important numeric factors jointly affect outcomes
   - Immediately reveals patterns across the continuous spectrum of both variables

2. **Prevailing Wage (numeric) + Education (categorical) + Case Status (hue)**
   - Box plots or violin plots grouped by education
   - Shows wage distributions by education level and approval status

3. **Company Age (numeric) + Continent (categorical) + Case Status (hue)**
   - Box plots or strip plots by continent
   - Reveals if company age impacts applications differently by region

These would provide much richer insights than the categorical-categorical combinations I suggested earlier. Thank you for the correction.
