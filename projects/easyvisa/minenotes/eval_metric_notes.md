Why Recall ?

1. **Regulatory perspective**: The visa program's purpose is to protect US workers while allowing qualified foreign workers. Missing a case that should be denied (false negative) could undermine this protection.

2. **Cost of errors**: 
   - False positive (predicting Certified when actually Denied): Could allow unqualified applicants through, potentially affecting US labor market
   - False negative (predicting Denied when actually Certified): Delays a qualified applicant, but they can appeal or reapply

3. **Stakeholder impact**: Government agencies would likely prefer to err on the side of caution (higher recall for Denied) to ensure compliance with regulations.

4. **Practical implementation**: A model with high recall for "Denied" ensures suspicious applications get proper human review, while clear approvals can be processed more efficiently.

The consequences of incorrectly approving an application that should be denied are typically more serious than incorrectly flagging an application for review.
