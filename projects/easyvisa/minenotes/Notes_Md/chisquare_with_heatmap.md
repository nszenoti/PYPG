### **Chi-Square Test with Heatmap**
A **Chi-Square test** is used to determine if there is a **significant relationship** between two categorical variables. A **heatmap** can then visualize the relationship by showing the difference between observed and expected frequencies.

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ What is the Chi-Square Test?**
- It checks if two categorical variables are **independent** or **related**.
- Uses a **contingency table (crosstab)**.
- Compares **observed values** with **expected values**.
- If the difference is large, the variables are likely related.

üìå **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**: The two variables are independent (no relationship).  
üìå **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**: The two variables are dependent (have a relationship).

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Steps to Perform a Chi-Square Test**
1. Create a **contingency table** (using `pd.crosstab()`).
2. Apply **Chi-Square Test** (`scipy.stats.chi2_contingency`).
3. Extract the **expected values** and compare them with the observed ones.
4. Use a **heatmap to visualize differences**.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Chi-Square Test + Heatmap**
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# Sample categorical dataset
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Category1': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'A'],
    'Category2': ['X', 'Y', 'X', 'Z', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']
})

# Step 1: Create contingency table
ct = pd.crosstab(df['Category1'], df['Category2'])

# Step 2: Perform Chi-Square Test
chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(ct)

# Step 3: Convert expected values to DataFrame for visualization
expected_df = pd.DataFrame(expected, index=ct.index, columns=ct.columns)

# Step 4: Plot heatmap (Observed vs. Expected)
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))

# Observed values heatmap
sns.heatmap(ct, annot=True, cmap="Blues", fmt="d", ax=axes[0])
axes[0].set_title("Observed Frequencies")

# Expected values heatmap
sns.heatmap(expected_df, annot=True, cmap="Reds", fmt=".1f", ax=axes[1])
axes[1].set_title("Expected Frequencies")

plt.show()

# Step 5: Print Chi-Square Test result
print(f"Chi-Square Statistic: {chi2}")
print(f"P-value: {p}")

# Decision based on p-value
alpha = 0.05  # Significance level
if p < alpha:
    print("Reject H‚ÇÄ: There is a significant relationship between Category1 and Category2")
else:
    print("Fail to reject H‚ÇÄ: No significant relationship found")
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ How to Interpret the Results?**
1. **Observed vs. Expected Frequencies**  
   - If observed values (blue heatmap) and expected values (red heatmap) **differ a lot**, the variables are **likely related**.
   
2. **Chi-Square Statistic & P-value**  
   - If `p < 0.05`: Reject **H‚ÇÄ**, meaning **variables are dependent** (significantly related).
   - If `p ‚â• 0.05`: Fail to reject **H‚ÇÄ**, meaning **variables are independent** (no strong relationship).

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Why Use a Heatmap?**
- It helps visualize **which categories differ most** from expected values.
- Highlights **patterns of dependence** between categorical variables.
- Useful in business, social sciences, and medical research.

### **Final Thoughts**
‚úÖ **Chi-Square Test tells you if two categorical variables are related.**  
‚úÖ **Heatmaps help visualize the relationship (Observed vs. Expected frequencies).**  
‚úÖ **If p < 0.05, the relationship is statistically significant!**

QUESTION

Does Chi-Square is performed on top of CrossTab ? Why ? 

Reply

Yes! The **Chi-Square test** is performed **on top of a crosstab** because:  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Crosstab = Frequency Table (Observed Values)**
- A **crosstab** (`pd.crosstab()`) creates a **contingency table**, which counts how often each combination of two categorical variables occurs.  
- This provides the **observed frequencies** (what actually happened).  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Chi-Square Test = Comparing Observed vs. Expected**
- The **Chi-Square test** checks if the observed frequencies (from the crosstab) **differ significantly** from the expected frequencies (assuming the two variables are independent).  
- **Expected frequencies** are calculated based on row & column totals, assuming no relationship.  

üìå **In short:**  
üëâ **Crosstab gives raw counts** (observed frequencies).  
üëâ **Chi-Square test checks if the counts are significantly different from expected frequencies** (if variables are independent).  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Why Use Crosstab for Chi-Square?**
| **Reason** | **Explanation** |
|------------|----------------|
| **Crosstab provides raw categorical data** | Chi-Square needs a table with counts (not continuous values). |
| **Chi-Square compares observed vs. expected** | Crosstab gives the observed counts, and Chi-Square computes expected counts. |
| **Chi-Square tests independence** | If the observed counts are very different from expected, variables are related. |

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Why Crosstab is Needed First?**
Let‚Äôs say we have **customer purchase behavior** based on gender:  

| Gender ‚Üí  | Bought A | Bought B | Bought C | Row Total |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Male      | **30**  | **10**  | **20**  | **60**   |
| Female    | **20**  | **40**  | **30**  | **90**   |
| **Col Total** | 50 | 50 | 50 | 150 |

- **Step 1**: `pd.crosstab(Gender, Purchase)` gives this **Observed Table**.
- **Step 2**: Chi-Square calculates **Expected Table** assuming independence.
- **Step 3**: If the difference is large ‚Üí Gender & Purchase are related.

‚úÖ **Without crosstab, there would be no frequency table to compare!**
