Yes, if we **wanted** to handle the skewness, here are the common approaches:  

ðŸ”¹ **Log Transformation (`log1p`)** â†’ Compresses large values, making distribution more normal.  
ðŸ”¹ **Capping (Winsorization)** â†’ Limits extreme values (e.g., 99th percentile).  
ðŸ”¹ **Binning** â†’ Convert into categories (e.g., Small, Medium, Large companies).  

But since **tree-based models are robust to skewness**, transformation isn't necessary for them.  
For linear models like Logistic Regression, transformation **would be beneficial**.  

Let me know if you want to apply any transformation or move to the next feature! ðŸš€
