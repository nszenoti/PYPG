Yes! The `categories` parameter in `OrdinalEncoder` is a **list of lists**, where each inner list corresponds to the ordering for a specific column. The order of the lists in `categories` **must match** the column order in the `fit_transform()` (or `fit()`) method.

### Breakdown:
```python
encoder = OrdinalEncoder(categories=[education_order, experience_order])
df[["education", "experience"]] = encoder.fit_transform(df[["education", "experience"]])
```
- `categories=[education_order, experience_order]`
  - The **first** list (`education_order`) applies to the **first column** in `df[["education", "experience"]]` (which is `"education"`).
  - The **second** list (`experience_order`) applies to the **second column** in `df[["education", "experience"]]` (which is `"experience"`).

So, if you swapped the column order in `df[["education", "experience"]]`, you would also need to swap the order in `categories` to ensure correct mapping.

Would you like to verify this with a small test? ðŸš€
