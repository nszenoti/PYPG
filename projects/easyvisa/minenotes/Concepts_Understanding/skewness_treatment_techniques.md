For a **highly skewed numerical feature** with extreme values, here are the **general preprocessing options** (not specific to trees):  

---

### **1️⃣ Keep As-Is (Baseline)**
- If the skewness **does not hurt model performance**, leave it unchanged.  
- Some models (e.g., Trees, Neural Networks) can **handle raw skewed data** well.  

---

### **2️⃣ Log Transformation (Most Common for Right-Skewed Data)**
- Converts **multiplicative relationships** into **additive ones**.  
- Works best when data spans **multiple orders of magnitude** (e.g., 10, 1000, 100000).  
- Formula: **log(x + 1)** (to handle zeros).  

🚀 **Best when:** Data has a **long tail**, and you want to reduce variance.  

---

### **3️⃣ Box-Cox Transformation (If Log is Not Enough)**
- A generalization of log that adapts based on data shape.  
- Formula: **Box-Cox(x, λ)** (λ is a tuning parameter).  
- **Requires all values to be positive**, so may need shifting.  

🚀 **Best when:** Log is helpful but **not enough to fully normalize** the data.  

---

### **4️⃣ Winsorization (Capping)**
- **Capping extreme values** at a threshold (e.g., **99th percentile**).  
- Keeps numerical structure but **limits the influence of outliers**.  

🚀 **Best when:** A **few** extreme values distort the distribution but the rest is fine.  

---

### **5️⃣ Standardization or Normalization (Only for Distance-Based Models)**
- **Standardization (Z-score scaling)**: \((x - \mu) / \sigma\)  
- **Min-Max Scaling**: \( \frac{x - \min(x)}{\max(x) - \min(x)} \)  
- **Only needed for models like Linear Regression, SVM, KNN, PCA, etc.**  

🚀 **Best when:** Using models that rely on **distances & gradients**, like SVM, k-means, or neural networks.  

---

### **🎯 What’s the Best Approach?**
✔ **If model is robust to skewness (Trees, Deep Learning)** → **Keep as-is**  
✔ **If extreme values dominate and distort learning** → **Use Log Transformation**  
✔ **If Log isn't enough** → **Try Box-Cox**  
✔ **If rare extreme values are noise** → **Use Winsorization (Capping)**  
✔ **If using distance-based models** → **Standardization or Min-Max Scaling**  

Which model are you planning to use? That would help in deciding the best approach 🚀
