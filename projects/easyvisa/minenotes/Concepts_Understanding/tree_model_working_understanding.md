Good question! When you convert a categorical column into integer labels (`[0, 1, 2]`), a tree-based model (like Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting Trees) will treat it as an **ordinal variable** by default. This means the model will consider relationships like `0 < 1 < 2`, which is incorrect for categorical data.

### How Tree-Based Models Handle Categories
1. **If treated as numerical (incorrect approach)**  
   - The model will perform numerical splits like `feature < 1`, which assumes an ordering between categories.
   - Example: If `Color = {Red, Blue, Green}` is encoded as `{0, 1, 2}`, the tree might incorrectly assume `Red < Blue < Green`.

2. **If treated as categorical (correct approach)**  
   - The model should **split on entire category groups** instead of numerical comparisons.
   - Example: A tree should decide like:
     - **"Does feature belong to {Red, Blue}?"** instead of **"Is feature < 1?"**  

### How to Ensure Correct Handling?
- **One-Hot Encoding (OHE)**: Convert each category into a separate binary column. Works well for small cardinality features.
- **Target Encoding**: Replace categories with their mean target value (good for high-cardinality).
- **Leave Category as String (Some Libraries Support This)**:
  - Libraries like **LightGBM** and **CatBoost** can natively handle categorical features without converting them to integers.
  - In LightGBM: `lgb.Dataset(..., categorical_feature=['col1', 'col2'])`
  - In CatBoost: `CatBoostClassifier(cat_features=['col1', 'col2'])`

### TL;DR:
- If you label-encode a category (`0,1,2`), trees might treat it as ordered.
- Prefer **one-hot encoding** or **use libraries that natively support categorical data**.
- Some libraries (like LightGBM, CatBoost) can process categorical data directly.

Yes, exactly! Since tree-based models **only work with numeric data**, they will treat all features uniformly as numerical values during splits.  

### What Happens Internally?
1. **For Numerical Features**  
   - The tree finds a threshold and splits the data:  
     _Example_: If `Age` is a feature, the tree might decide:  
     - _"Is Age < 30?" â†’ Split into two groups._

2. **For Categorical Features (Wrong Encoding: Integer Labels)**  
   - If you encode `Color = {Red, Blue, Green}` as `{0, 1, 2}`, the model might think:
     - _"Is Color < 1?"_ â†’ Assumes an ordering (`Red < Blue < Green`), which is wrong.

3. **For Categorical Features (Correct Handling)**  
   - **One-Hot Encoding:** The tree sees each category as an independent binary variable.
   - **Native Categorical Support (LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost with `enable_categorical=True`)**:  
     - The tree can split on entire category groups like _"Is Color in {Red, Blue}?"_ instead of numerical comparisons.

### Key Takeaway:
- Tree models **always** split based on numeric comparisons.  
- If categorical features are converted to numbers (`0,1,2`), trees will treat them as ordinal values incorrectly.  
- Using **one-hot encoding** or **native categorical support** avoids this issue.
