In general rule of thumb you say missing value after split but in earlier you put before 
what the hack is going on

Good catch! Let me clarify.  

### **When to Handle Missing Values?**  
It depends on **why** you're handling them:  

âœ… **Before Split:**  
- If you're **removing rows** with missing values (because they are irrelevant or too many missing).  
- If you're **filling missing values using external domain knowledge** (not based on data patterns).  

âœ… **After Split (Using Train Data Only):**  
- If you're **learning imputation from data** (mean/median/mode, KNN imputation).  
- This is crucial because test data should not influence imputation values.  

### **Final Rule of Thumb:**  
ðŸ‘‰ **If missing values are handled manually (like dropping rows), do it before.**  
ðŸ‘‰ **If missing values are filled based on dataset patterns (like mean/median), do it after using only train data.**  

Hope that clears it up! ðŸš€


Exactly! ðŸš€  

**âœ… Before Split:** If you're manually handling missing values (like dropping rows or filling based on external knowledge).  

**âœ… After Split:** If you're using statistical or model-based imputation (like mean, median, mode, KNN, regression) because these methods **learn from data** and should only learn from the training set.  

Now you donâ€™t need to memorizeâ€”just think:  
ðŸ‘‰ **"Am I manually fixing data?"** â†’ Before split.  
ðŸ‘‰ **"Am I learning from data?"** â†’ After split (using train only).  

You got it! ðŸ”¥
