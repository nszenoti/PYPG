Categorical 

* Stacked/Segmented Bar Chart 
- Shows us percentage of proportions within each category 
  But
  It doesn't reveal how Dominant Category is compare to others

  It might give idea about strong/weak splits but not good idea about dominant/rare categories

* Mosiaic Plot 
- Gives idea about both 
  Dominant/Rare Categories
  &
  Strong/Weak Splits
