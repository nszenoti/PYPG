Yes, exactly!  

- The **preprocessor (`ColumnTransformer`)** behaves like an encoder/scaler. It has `fit()`, `transform()`, and `fit_transform()` methods, just like `OrdinalEncoder` or `StandardScaler`.  
- The **final pipeline (`Pipeline`)** behaves like a model. It has `fit()`, `predict()`, and `score()`, similar to `DecisionTreeClassifier` or any other ML model.  

### **Summary of API Behavior:**  
- `preprocessor.fit_transform(X)` â†’ Works like an encoder, returns transformed features.  
- `pipeline.fit(X, y)` â†’ Trains the model, internally transforming data before fitting.  
- `pipeline.predict(X)` â†’ Transforms `X` on the fly and makes predictions.  

So, the **pipeline integrates both preprocessing and modeling seamlessly**, making it behave like a single end-to-end model. ðŸš€
