Not all of them! Here's a clear distinction between **outlier treatment** and **handling skewness**:

### **ðŸ”¹ Outlier Treatment Techniques (For Extreme Values)**
Used when a **few rare values** distort analysis or model performance.  

âœ” **Winsorization (Capping)** â†’ Limits extreme values (e.g., cap at the 99th percentile).  
âœ” **Truncation (Removing Outliers)** â†’ Completely removes extreme points (risky, use carefully).  
âœ” **Clipping** â†’ Similar to capping, but hard-limits values (e.g., max at $500K).  
âœ” **Imputation** â†’ Replace extreme values with a threshold or median (only if data errors are suspected).  

ðŸš€ **Goal:** Reduce the influence of extreme values **without changing overall distribution**.

### **ðŸ”¹ Skewness Treatment Techniques (For Whole Distribution)**
Used when a **feature is heavily skewed**, regardless of outliers.  

âœ” **Log Transformation** â†’ Smooths right-skewed data (e.g., income, loan amounts).  
âœ” **Box-Cox Transformation** â†’ Generalized log transformation that adapts to data shape.  
âœ” **Power Transformations (Yeo-Johnson, Square Root, etc.)** â†’ Helps normalize distributions.  

ðŸš€ **Goal:** **Compress high values**, spread the distribution more evenly, and make it resemble a normal shape.

### **ðŸŽ¯ Key Difference**
- **Outlier Treatment** â†’ Fixes **a few extreme values**  
- **Skewness Treatment** â†’ Adjusts **the whole distribution**  

If your **data has both skewness & extreme values**, you may need **both techniques**:  
ðŸ“Œ **First, handle extreme outliers (capping or removing if necessary).**  
ðŸ“Œ **Then, apply transformations (log, Box-Cox) if skewness remains.**  

Would you like to check if **skewness reduction** helps in your case, or are you more concerned with just extreme values? ðŸš€
