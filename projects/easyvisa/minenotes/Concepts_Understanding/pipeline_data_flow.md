pipeline_data_flow


Here’s an **intuitive flowchart-style explanation** of how `X_train` flows through the pipeline and why column order changes:

### **Pipeline Data Flow**  
📥 **Input (X_train - Original Order)**  
`["gender", "education", "experience", "age", "income"]`  

⬇️ **Step 1: ColumnTransformer applies transformations**  
- **Ordinal Encoding** → `["education", "experience"]` → **Numeric Order Applied**  
- **Label Encoding** → `["gender"]` → **Converted to Numeric**  
- **Passthrough** → `["age", "income"]` → **Remain Unchanged**  

📤 **Output (X_transformed - New Order)**  
`["education (encoded)", "experience (encoded)", "gender (encoded)", "age", "income"]`  

⬇️ **Step 2: Model Training**  
- The model **does not see original column names**  
- It learns patterns based on **transformed numeric values**

🔹 **Key Takeaways**:  
✔️ **Transformed columns come first** (based on `ColumnTransformer` order).  
✔️ **Passthrough columns keep their order but appear last**.  
✔️ **Model does not retain column names**, only numeric data structure.  
✔️ **Feature importance must be mapped back manually** if needed.  

This should serve as a quick **mental model** whenever you revisit! 🚀
