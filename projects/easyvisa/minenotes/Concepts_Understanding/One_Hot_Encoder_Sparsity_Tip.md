One_Hot_Encoder_Sparsity_Tip

We set `sparse_output=False` in OneHotEncoder because:

1. Dense arrays are more compatible with most scikit-learn models
2. It makes debugging easier (you can print and inspect the transformed data)
3. For small to medium datasets, the memory advantage of sparse matrices is minimal
4. It avoids potential compatibility issues in the pipeline

This ensures our transformed data is in a standard format that works seamlessly with all models.
