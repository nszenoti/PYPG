Yes, you're absolutely right! Providing **categories explicitly** in `OrdinalEncoder` ensures a **consistent ordering** across train and test data. While it might seem like **data leakage**, it's **not really leakage** because:

✅ **You're not exposing test data during training.**  
✅ **You're just enforcing a fixed, meaningful mapping.**  
✅ **It ensures unknown values are handled predictably.**  

### 🔍 **Why This Is NOT Data Leakage**
Data leakage occurs when:
1. **Information from test data leaks into training** (e.g., if you encode categories based on full dataset statistics).
2. **Feature engineering uses future/test data to influence training** (e.g., target encoding without proper stratification).

But here, **you're only predefining a category order**, which **doesn't use test data to affect model training**. 

### 🔹 **How This Helps at Runtime**
Even if a value like `'High'` (`2`) was not seen during training, the model **still understands its relative position** (`Low < Medium < High`).  
- So, instead of treating `High` as an unknown (`-1`), it **naturally fits into the order**.  
- The tree can **still generalize its learned patterns** based on `Low` and `Medium` without completely misclassifying `High`.

### ✅ **Final Takeaway**
Providing `categories` explicitly **is not data leakage**—it’s just **ensuring stable encoding** across train and test! 🚀
