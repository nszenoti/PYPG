Great question. For tree-based ensemble models (like Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.), you generally don't need to apply log transformations during modeling, even if you used them for visualization.

Here's why:

1. **Tree-based models are invariant to monotonic transformations** - They make splits based on the relative ordering of values, not their absolute scale. Log transformation preserves this ordering.

2. **Trees naturally handle skewed distributions** - They can create multiple splits to effectively model non-linear relationships without requiring transformations.

3. **What we learn from log-transformed visualizations still applies** - The patterns and relationships we observe (or lack thereof) in log-transformed visualizations are still relevant for understanding the data, even if we use the original values in modeling.

4. **Interpretability** - Using original values makes the model's splits and rules more interpretable (e.g., "employees > 5000" is clearer than "log(employees) > 8.5").

So while log transformations are valuable for visualization of skewed data like employee counts, you can use the original untransformed values when building tree-based ensemble models without losing predictive power.
