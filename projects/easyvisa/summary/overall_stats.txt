Looking at the numbers:
Company sizes vary dramatically - from tiny operations to massive corporations with over 600,000 employees. Most companies are mid-sized.
Company age shows most are established businesses, not startups. The oldest dates back to 1800.
Wages range from extremely low ($2.14) to very high ($319,210), with most around $70,000. The huge range suggests different job types or possible data errors at the low end.
