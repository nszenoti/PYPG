The main difference between Phi-3-mini and Phi-3-mini-4k is the context window size:

- **Phi-3-mini**: Has a 2K token context window (can process up to ~2,000 tokens at once)
- **Phi-3-mini-4k**: Has a 4K token context window (can process up to ~4,000 tokens at once)

For your RAG application with medical texts, I recommend using **Phi-3-mini-4k** because:

1. The larger context window will allow the model to process more text at once
2. This is important when dealing with medical information that might require longer contexts
3. You'll be able to include more retrieved passages from the Merck Manual in each prompt
4. The parameter count is the same (1.8B), so there's no performance penalty

The 4K version will give you more flexibility when working with longer medical texts while maintaining the same efficiency on your T4 GPU.
