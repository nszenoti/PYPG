# Analysis of Problem Statement and Business Context

The task involves developing a RAG-based AI solution for healthcare professionals using medical manuals (specifically The Merck Manuals) to address information overload and support clinical decision-making. The solution needs to answer specific medical questions about protocols, treatments, and procedures.

## Key Requirements:
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation
- Using Google Colab with T4 GPU
- Processing a large medical manual (4,000+ pages)
- Answering specific medical questions accurately
- Efficient model that works well with free Colab resources

## Model Options for Free Colab with T4 GPU

For a lightweight, efficient LLM that works well on Colab's free tier with T4 GPU, here are some good options:

1. **Phi-3-mini-4k** (1.8B parameters) - Microsoft's small but capable model
2. **Gemma-2B** - Google's efficient small model
3. **TinyLlama-1.1B** - Extremely lightweight
4. **FLAN-T5-small** (80M parameters) - Very small and efficient
5. **Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2** - Slightly larger but excellent performance/size ratio
6. **Llama-3-8B** - Larger but very capable if resources permit

For your RAG application on free Colab, I'd recommend focusing on models under 7B parameters to ensure smooth operation with the T4 GPU limitations.
