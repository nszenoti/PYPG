Great question!

When you're writing out ER diagram details **in a plain text format** (like for documentation or to share with an LLM), here's how relationships are typically conveyed:

---

### âœ… **1. Define Entities Separately**

List each entity (table) with its attributes and mark keys:

```text
Entity: Customer
- customer_id (PK)
- name
- email

Entity: Order
- order_id (PK)
- order_date
- amount
- customer_id (FK â†’ Customer.customer_id)
```

> âœ… **In-line FK notation** (like above) is the most common and readable way to **embed relationships** directly inside entity definitions.

---

### âœ… **2. Optionally, List Relationships Separately**

To make relationships more explicit, you can include a **separate section** at the bottom for clarity:

```text
Relationships:
- Customer (1) â€” places â€” (many) Order
  - Order.customer_id â†’ Customer.customer_id
```

This makes the relationship clear even outside of table context and helps LLMs or tools parsing the text.

### ðŸ“Œ Summary of Best Practices for Text Format:

| Aspect                | Recommendation                                                                   |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Entity Definition** | List all entities with their attributes, mark PK and FK                          |
| **Relationship**      | Show FK inline **and** optionally describe in a separate "Relationships" section |
| **Clarity**           | Always show what the FK references â€” `FK â†’ Table.column`                         |
| **Cardinality**       | Use terms like `1:N` or words like "one to many", optionally even diagrams       |

### âœ… Example Summary (Final Format):

```text
Entity: Customer
- customer_id (PK)
- name
- email

Entity: Order
- order_id (PK)
- order_date
- amount
- customer_id (FK â†’ Customer.customer_id)

Relationships:
- One Customer can have many Orders.
- Each Order belongs to one Customer.
- Relationship: Customer (1) â€” places â€” (many) Order
```
