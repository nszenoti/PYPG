Yes — you're exactly right, and let’s frame it even more precisely 👇

## ✅ Window Function Intuition

### 🔸 What is a Window Function?

A **window function** performs a calculation **across a set of rows related to the current row**, but **does NOT collapse rows** like `GROUP BY`.

> Think of it as:
> *"Add an **extra column** with some calculation, looking at a sliding/grouped 'window' of rows."*

## 🔄 Comparison with Group By

| Feature                        | `GROUP BY`                      | `WINDOW FUNCTION`                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Collapses rows into groups     | ✅ Yes                           | ❌ No — keeps original rows                |
| Applies aggregates             | ✅ Yes (e.g. `SUM()`, `COUNT()`) | ✅ Yes (e.g. `SUM() OVER (...)`)           |
| Can access individual rows     | ❌ No — grouped only             | ✅ Yes — works row-by-row with context     |
| Allows multi-level analysis    | ❌ Hard                          | ✅ Easy with `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` |
| Needs to be used with GROUP BY | ✅ Usually                       | ❌ Can work with or without GROUP BY       |

## 🔍 So your idea:

> “So whatever we do via Rank(), it's similar to manipulating individual column if not used window function?”
> “Window function is like manipulating column on top of group by results (if any).”

✅ **Correct.**

* If there's no `GROUP BY`, it works on raw data (row-by-row).
* If there's `GROUP BY`, and you use a window function in the outer query, then:

  > It manipulates columns **on top of** the **aggregated rows** (grouped result).

## 🔁 Examples:

### 📌 Without `GROUP BY`:

```sql
SELECT
  name,
  department,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dept_rank
FROM employee_t
```

* Ranks employees **within each department** by salary
* Keeps all rows

---

### 📌 With `GROUP BY`:

```sql
SELECT
  department,
  role,
  COUNT(*) AS total,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
FROM employee_t
GROUP BY department, role
```

* Groups by dept+role
* Then **ranks those grouped roles** by how many people are in each role per dept
