Great question! You're digging into the **interaction between `GROUP BY` and window functions** ‚Äî let's break it down clearly:

---

### ‚úÖ Query Context:

```sql
SELECT
    quarter_number,
    customer_feedback,
    COUNT(*) AS feedback_count,
    ROUND(
        COUNT(*) * 100.0 /
        SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY quarter_number),
        2
    ) AS percentage
FROM order_t
WHERE customer_feedback IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY quarter_number, customer_feedback
ORDER BY quarter_number, percentage DESC;
```

---

### üîç Key Concepts at Play:

#### 1. `GROUP BY quarter_number, customer_feedback`

This means:

* Each row in the result is **one unique `(quarter_number, customer_feedback)`** combination.
* `COUNT(*)` gives the number of such records in that group.

#### 2. `SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY quarter_number)`

This is where it gets interesting.

You‚Äôre doing a **window function on top of the grouped result**.

So for each `(quarter_number, customer_feedback)` row:

* `COUNT(*)` is just the count of that specific combination.
* `SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY quarter_number)` will:

  * Consider **all the grouped rows that share the same `quarter_number`**
  * Sum their counts to get the **total feedback entries in that quarter**

It‚Äôs a clever trick!

---

### üî¢ Example:

Let‚Äôs say your grouped data looks like this (after `GROUP BY`):

| quarter\_number | customer\_feedback | COUNT(\*) |
| --------------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| Q1              | Positive           | 40        |
| Q1              | Neutral            | 30        |
| Q1              | Negative           | 30        |
| Q2              | Positive           | 20        |
| Q2              | Negative           | 80        |

Now `SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY quarter_number)` does:

* For each row in Q1 ‚Üí `40 + 30 + 30 = 100`
* For each row in Q2 ‚Üí `20 + 80 = 100`

So your final output with percentage becomes:

| quarter\_number | customer\_feedback | feedback\_count | percentage |
| --------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ---------- |
| Q1              | Positive           | 40              | 40.00%     |
| Q1              | Neutral            | 30              | 30.00%     |
| Q1              | Negative           | 30              | 30.00%     |
| Q2              | Negative           | 80              | 80.00%     |
| Q2              | Positive           | 20              | 20.00%     |

### üß† Summary:

* The outer `GROUP BY` does the usual row collapsing.
* The window function `SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (...)` works **after** the grouping ‚Äî treating each grouped row as a new input row.
* The `PARTITION BY quarter_number` tells SQL to **sum within each quarter**, allowing you to compute percentages **within** each quarter.

‚úÖ So yes ‚Äî **even though `COUNT(*)` is grouped by 2 columns**, the **window just uses `quarter_number`** to define its scope and rolls up counts correctly per quarter.

Let me know if you want this broken down visually or in CTEs for clarity!

---

Yes, you're exactly right to question this ‚Äî and your instinct is spot on.

### üí° Let‚Äôs clarify:

When you write this:

```sql
SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY quarter_number)
```

‚Ä¶it **does not sum all `COUNT(*)` values in the result set** ‚Äî only the ones **within the same `quarter_number`** (i.e., the partition).

---

### üß† Why?

Because of how **window functions** + **`PARTITION BY`** work:

* `COUNT(*)` is evaluated **per group** (due to `GROUP BY`)
* Then `SUM(...) OVER (PARTITION BY quarter_number)` **treats each grouped row as a row in a partition**, and sums up values of `COUNT(*)` within each partition

---

### üîÅ Think of it like this:

Imagine you had these grouped rows:

| quarter\_number | customer\_feedback | count |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ----- |
| Q1              | Positive           | 40    |
| Q1              | Neutral            | 30    |
| Q1              | Negative           | 30    |
| Q2              | Positive           | 20    |
| Q2              | Negative           | 80    |

Now:

* For rows where `quarter_number = Q1`, your partition is:

  ```
  [40, 30, 30]
  ```

  So each gets a `SUM = 100`

* For rows with `quarter_number = Q2`:

  ```
  [20, 80]
  ```

  So each gets a `SUM = 100`

‚úÖ Each row‚Äôs percentage is then its own count divided by the total count for its partition.

---

### üîé What if you removed `PARTITION BY`?

```sql
SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER ()
```

Now, all rows (no matter the quarter) are in a **single partition**. You'd get a grand total of all feedback counts across **all quarters**, and your percentage would be **global**, not per-quarter.

---

### TL;DR:

* ‚úÖ `PARTITION BY` scopes the window to **only those rows sharing the same value**.
* ‚úÖ That‚Äôs **why it doesn‚Äôt consider all**, only what's inside that partition.
* ‚úÖ It's **by design**, to let you compare local values to group totals.

Let me know if you'd like to see this in a CTE with full output!
