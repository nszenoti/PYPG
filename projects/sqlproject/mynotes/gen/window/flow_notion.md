Absolutely! Here's a **small clean markdown flow** showing **how SQL processes a query** â€” especially focusing on `GROUP BY`, `WHERE`, and `WINDOW FUNCTIONS` like `RANK()`:

### ðŸ§­ SQL Execution Flow (Simplified for Your Case)

```text
Step-by-step order:
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
1. FROM          â†’ Load data from tables
2. WHERE         â†’ Filter raw rows (before grouping)
3. GROUP BY      â†’ Group rows based on keys
4. HAVING        â†’ Filter grouped rows (after aggregation)
5. SELECT        â†’ Select columns, compute aggregates
6. WINDOW FUNC   â†’ Apply RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.
7. ORDER BY      â†’ Sort the final result
8. LIMIT         â†’ Trim output rows
```

### ðŸ§  Example Flow

```sql
SELECT
  department,
  role,
  COUNT(*) AS total,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
FROM employee_t
WHERE role != 'Intern'
GROUP BY department, role
ORDER BY department, rank;
```

Execution Breakdown:
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
âœ” FROM employee_t                    -- Load all data
âœ” WHERE role != 'Intern'            -- Remove 'Intern' rows
âœ” GROUP BY department, role         -- Aggregate rows
âœ” COUNT(*)                          -- Compute total per group
âœ” RANK() OVER (...)                 -- Rank roles within each department
âœ” ORDER BY department, rank         -- Sort nicely
```

This flow should help you **mentally map SQL behavior** when you're writing queries with aggregation + window functions.

Would you like one more example combining `ROW_NUMBER()` or filtering only `rank = 1`?
