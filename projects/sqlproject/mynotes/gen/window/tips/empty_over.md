Here's a **simple takeaway** about using `OVER()` and when it's needed:

---

### ✅ **Key Purpose of `OVER()`**

`OVER()` is used to turn an **aggregate function** into a **window function**, so you can:

* Compute **totals or averages** across **entire table or partition**
* Without collapsing rows like `GROUP BY` does

---

### 💡 **Why/When You Need `OVER()`**

| Use Case                            | Example                                               | `OVER()` Needed? |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Total sum across all rows           | `SUM(sales) OVER ()`                                  | ✅ Yes            |
| Running total per group             | `SUM(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY date)` | ✅ Yes            |
| % of total using grouped result     | `COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER ()`                    | ✅ Yes            |
| Regular aggregation collapsing rows | `SUM(sales)` with `GROUP BY`                          | ❌ No             |

### 🧠 **Simple Rule of Thumb**

> If you want to **keep row-level detail** and still use aggregation logic → use `OVER()`
> If you use `GROUP BY`, and want a **value from the full result set** → use `OVER()`

---

### 📌 Example:

```sql
SELECT
    department,
    COUNT(employee_id) AS dept_total,
    SUM(COUNT(employee_id)) OVER () AS grand_total
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

> Without `OVER()`, `SUM(COUNT(...))` would error.
> With `OVER()`, it works and gives the grand total **repeated in every row**.
