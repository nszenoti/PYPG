Insights (Quarter Revenue Trend)

2. While order volume decreased each quarter, the average revenue per order remained fairly consistent (except for Q4).
3. Quarter 4 saw the lowest net revenue and average revenue per order, indicating potential issues with customer engagement or pricing.

ðŸ§  Noteworthy Observations (Quarter Revenue Trend)
- Despite Q3 having fewer orders than Q2, it had slightly higher avg revenue per order, showing improved per-order sales efficiency.
- Monitoring average revenue per order can help detect discount impact or pricing strategy effectiveness over time.


**Business Recommendations**: (Declining QoQ revenue)
- Investigate causes behind this consistent decline:
  - Was there a drop in orders or a change in discounting strategy?
  - Was customer sentiment (feedback) worsening across quarters? (links back to Q5)
- Consider running targeted campaigns or reviewing pricing/discounting models to recover revenue.

Credit Card (Biz)

- Laser, Mastercard, and American Express received the highest average discounts
- The minimal discount variation suggests credit card type isn't a major factor in pricing strategy.
- JCB dominates market share
