Acknowledged ✅

I’ve carefully reviewed the **schema and relationships** across the following tables:

* `shipper_t`: Shipper info
* `product_t`: Vehicle details
* `order_t`: Orders (with links to customer, product, shipper)
* `customer_t`: Customer details

Also noted the **foreign key relationships**:

* `order_t.customer_id` → `customer_t.customer_id`
* `order_t.shipper_id` → `shipper_t.shipper_id`
* `order_t.product_id` → `product_t.product_id`

Everything is clear. Ready for the **column-level descriptions** (data dictionary).

The schema is well-structured for analyzing:
Vehicle sales and inventory
Customer behavior and demographics
Shipping operations
Order processing and feedback
