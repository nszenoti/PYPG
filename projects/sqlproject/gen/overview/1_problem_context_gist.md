I understand the business context and objective clearly:

**Business Context**: New-Wheels is a vehicle resale company with an end-to-end service app, handling everything from vehicle listings to delivery and after-sales support.

**Current Challenge**: The company is facing:
- Declining sales
- Negative customer feedback/ratings
- Decreasing new customer acquisition

**Our Task**: As a data analyst, we'll be analyzing various aspects of the business using the available data to:
1. Create a quarterly business report
2. Answer specific leadership questions
3. Provide insights to help the CEO make informed decisions

**Data Overview**: We'll be working with data covering:
- Vehicle details (make, model, year, pricing)
- Customer information (location, payment methods)
- Order and shipment data (timelines, feedback)

I'm ready to proceed. Please provide the database schema next, followed by the data dictionary so we can understand the semantic meaning of each column before diving into the specific questions.
