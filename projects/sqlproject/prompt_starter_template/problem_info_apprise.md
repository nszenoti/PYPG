# Problem Info Apprise

Hi! Iâ€™m working on a hands-on SQL project to reinforce and master core SQL concepts. Iâ€™d like your help in solving a set of around 10 SQL problems one by one.

I'll provide a detailed database schema, and for each question, we'll collaboratively:

1. Understand the requirement.
2. Identify the right SQL techniques to use (from the concepts Iâ€™ve learned so far).
3. Craft an optimal, real-world style SQL query using best practices (ideally MySQL-compliant).
4. Finally, weâ€™ll write a short observation or explanation (ie laymen term insights and outcomes in 2 to 3 points)

ðŸ“š SQL Concepts covered so far are:

1. SQL basics: select, where, group by, having, order by
2. built in funcs: like numeric, string, date-related
3. joins: inner, left, etc ...
4. window functions: partition ,over, rank, lag(), etc ...
5. subqueries: esp using CTE for readbaility and modularise queries
6. Query order of execution (theory)

Nature of Questions

The questions will revolve around these concepts. The goal is not just to get the correct output, but to think like a SQL professional: use clean, expressive queries that reflect real-world design thinking such as clarity, reusability, performance-awareness, and avoiding unnecessary complexity.

Lemme know once you got it, I will give you problem context, objective, and rubric for entire task, data dictionary, etc ...

Working Plan for each question

1. Youâ€™ll help me break down the question logically.
2. Weâ€™ll identify which concept(s) best solve the problem (CTE vs subquery? window function vs aggregate?).
3. Weâ€™ll write the query and revise if needed for clarity/performance.
4. Weâ€™ll write a 2â€“3 line observation summarizing
   1. techniques used
   2. what insights we can gauge (2 to 3 points)
   3. any thing edge/alternatives worth noting (optional)

Once I share the schema, weâ€™ll begin with Question 1. Let me know when youâ€™re ready!
