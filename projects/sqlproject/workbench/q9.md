## Observations

1. Discount variation is minimal across cards:
   - Highest: Laser (0.64%)
   - Lowest: Diners-Club-International (0.58%)
   - Very narrow range (only 0.06% difference)

2. JCB dominates market share:
   - 423 customers (largest by far)
   - 424 orders (suggesting consistent usage)
   - Other cards average 30-80 customers each

3. Customer loyalty patterns:
   - Most cards show 1:1 customer-to-order ratio
   - Few cards (Mastercard, Maestro) show slight repeat purchases
   - Suggests limited repeat business across all card types

- Laser, Mastercard, and American Express received the highest average discounts
- The minimal discount variation suggests credit card type isn't a major factor in pricing strategy.
