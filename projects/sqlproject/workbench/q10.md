# Question 10:

What is the average time taken to ship the placed orders for each quarter? [3 marks]
> Hint: Please use the julianday function instead of the DATEDIFF function to find the difference between the ship date and the order date.

---

## Soltuion

**Query**

```sql
SELECT
    quarter_number,
    -- ROUND(AVG(JULIANDAY(ship_date) - JULIANDAY(order_date)), 2) as avg_days_to_ship,
    ROUND(AVG(DATEDIFF(ship_date, order_date)), 0) as avg_days_to_ship,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM order_t
GROUP BY quarter_number
ORDER BY quarter_number;
```

Result
```
| Quarter Number | Avg Days to Ship | Total Orders |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| 1              | 57               | 310           |
| 2              | 71               | 262           |
| 3              | 118              | 229           |
| 4              | 174              | 199           |
```

## Observation/Insights

**Observations**:

1. Severe deterioration in shipping performance:
   - Q1: 57 days average
   - Q4: 174 days average (3x longer than Q1)
   - Consistent quarter-over-quarter increase in delays

2. Correlation with order volume:
   - Orders decreased (310 → 199)
   - Yet shipping times increased dramatically
   - Suggests operational issues beyond just volume

3. Critical trend:
   - Q1→Q2: +14 days
   - Q2→Q3: +47 days
   - Q3→Q4: +56 days
   - Accelerating deterioration in service levels

**Insights**

- Consistent quarter-over-quarter increase in delays
- This indicates progressively slower logistics or fulfillment issues over time - a potential red flag for customer satisfaction.
- Trend suggests decreasing operational efficiency in order processing and shipping across quarters.

This explains earlier findings of declining customer satisfaction and reduced orders - shipping delays are getting significantly worse.
