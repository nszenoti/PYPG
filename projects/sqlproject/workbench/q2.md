## Observations

1. American brands dominate the top preferences:
   - Chevrolet leads significantly with 83 customers
   - Ford follows as second (63 customers)
   - Only one non-American brand (Toyota) in top 5

2. Interesting tie between Dodge and Pontiac (50 customers each), suggesting similar market appeal

3. Notable gap between market leader Chevrolet (83) and second-place Ford (63), indicating Chevrolet's strong market dominance in the pre-owned vehicle segment

- These top 5 makers contribute a significant chunk of orders â€” targeted promotions on these brands could drive quicker wins.
