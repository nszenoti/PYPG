        "1. **Response Time vs. Token Length**: Generating 512 tokens took significantly longer than shorter outputs. There appears to be a near-linear relationship between max_tokens and generation time.\n",

        "2. **Temperature Impact**: Lower temperature settings (0.1-0.2) produced more consistent, factual responses appropriate for medical information, while slightly higher values (0.3-0.4) introduced minor variations in phrasing without compromising accuracy.\n",
