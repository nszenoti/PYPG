There appears to be a near-linear relationship between max_tokens and generation time.\n","\n","2. **Temperature Impact**: Lower temperature settings (0.1-0.2) produced more consistent, factual responses appropriate for medical information, while slightly higher values (0.3-0.4) introduced minor variations in phrasing without compromising accuracy.\n","\n","3. **Prompt Engineering Effects**: Directive prompts (e.g., \"Answer step-by-step\") noticeably influenced the structure of responses, with the model generally following the requested format.\n","\n","4. **Default Value Optimization**: We settled on max_tokens=128 as the default for a balance between response quality and generation speed. This value provided sufficient detail for most medical questions while maintaining reasonable response times.\n","\n","5. **Optimal Balance**: The \"Balanced Approach\" (temp=0.3, top_p=0.8) provided a good compromise between factual accuracy and natural language flow for medical questions.\n","\n","6. **Conciseness vs. Completeness**: While the \"Concise Summary\" setting generated faster responses, some medical questions benefited from the additional context provided by longer outputs.\n","\n","7. **Persona Framing**: The \"Medical Expert Persona\" prompt appeared to elicit slightly more technical terminology and structured explanations compared to neutral prompts.\n","\n","8. **Token Efficiency**: Lower temperatures generally resulted in more information-dense responses, requiring fewer tokens to convey key medical information.\n","\n","9. **Model Limitations**: For complex medical protocols (like sepsis management), even the longest responses (384 tokens) sometimes felt truncated before completing the full explanation.\n","\n","***The responses generated by Phi-3 Mini were surprisingly coherent and informative, even without retrieval augmentation — suggesting that smaller models can still be leveraged for meaningful domain-specific reasoning when guided with the right prompt and sampling parameters.***"],"metadata":{"id":"LX-26Sku1ax2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data Preparation for RAG"],"metadata":{"id":"xsGV2u5B1Vir"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Loading the Data"],"metadata":{"id":"DT6zlPyY2NNx"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pwd"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"6TU1z_nN2YCo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746891875885,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":23,"user":{"displayName":"nipun shah","userId":"12196926442066524497"}},"outputId":"7314e472-2ee5-4c2c-b125-bee72e55df78"},"execution_count":72,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/medical_assist_academicway\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!ls -la"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"8_Vt8mMa3j0K","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746891855207,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":124,"user":{"displayName":"nipun shah","userId":"12196926442066524497"}},"outputId":"a95e6a90-7a35-4a2d-e983-4c5641044822"},"execution_count":70,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["total 19851\n","-rw------- 1 root root    46430 May 10 08:48 medical_assistant_learner_notebook.ipynb\n","-rw------- 1 root root 20150490 May  9 11:14 medical_diagnosis_manual.pdf\n","-rw------- 1 root root   125661 May 10 15:39 notebook1.ipynb\n","drwx------ 2 root root     4096 May 10 11:56 phi3_models\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["pdf_path = 'medical_diagnosis_manual.pdf'"],"metadata":{"id":"Ks-aV04U2SRz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746891870913,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1,"user":{"displayName":"nipun shah","userId":"12196926442066524497"}}},"execution_count":71,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# helper Functions\n","\n","def load_pdf_with_langchain(pdf_path):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Load a PDF file using LangChain's PyMuPDFLoader\n","\n","    Args:\n","        pdf_path: Path to the PDF file\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        List of document objects with page content and metadata\n","    \"\"\"\n","    if not os.path.exists(pdf_path):\n","        raise FileNotFoundError(f\"PDF file not found at {pdf_path}\")\n","\n","    #
