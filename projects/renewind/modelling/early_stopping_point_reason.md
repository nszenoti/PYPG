For your wind turbine failure prediction problem, here are appropriate early stopping parameters:

**Early Stopping Configuration:**

- **Monitor**: `'val_f2_score'` (since it balances recall and precision with emphasis on recall)
- **Mode**: `'max'` (since we want to maximize F2 score)
- **Patience**: `10-15` epochs (reasonable for this problem)
- **Min Delta**: `0.001` (small improvements may still be meaningful)
- **Restore Best Weights**: `True` (keep the best model, not the last one)

**Implementation Example:**
```python
early_stopping = keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(
    monitor='val_f2_score',
    mode='max',
    patience=12,
    min_delta=0.001,
    restore_best_weights=True,
    verbose=1
)
```

**Reasoning:**
- F2 score prioritizes recall (critical for catching failures) while still considering precision
- Patience of 10-15 gives the model enough time to improve but prevents excessive training
- Restoring best weights ensures you keep the model with highest validation performance
- Verbose=1 helps you track when early stopping is triggered

This configuration balances the need to catch failures with training efficiency and generalization.
