Ah, I see! Since there is significant class imbalance in the **Target** column, and you're planning to address it using techniques like adjusting the **loss function** or using appropriate **metrics** during model training, you're on the right track.

Here’s how you can handle it:

### 1. **Adjusting the Loss Function**:
   - You can adjust the loss function to account for the class imbalance. Commonly, for binary classification tasks, you can use **weighted loss** where you give more weight to the minority class (in your case, the "Failure" class).
   - For example, in **TensorFlow**, you can use `class_weight` or `sample_weight` in the `fit()` function.
     ```python
     from sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_class_weight

     # Compute class weights
     class_weights = compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=[0, 1], y=y_train)
     class_weights = dict(zip([0, 1], class_weights))

     model.fit(X_train, y_train, class_weight=class_weights)
     ```

### 2. **Using Appropriate Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Accuracy** might not be sufficient, especially with imbalanced classes. Instead, you should focus on metrics like:
     - **Precision, Recall, F1-score**: These metrics give more focus to how well your model performs with the minority class.
     - **ROC-AUC**: Measures the performance of a classification model across all classification thresholds.
     - **Confusion Matrix**: To observe how well the model is distinguishing between the two classes.

     You can compute these metrics using:
     ```python
     from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

     # After predictions
     print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
     ```

### 3. **Model Monitoring**:
   - Monitor your model's performance on both the **training** and **validation** sets using these metrics to ensure it’s not overfitting to the majority class.

### 4. **Handling the Class Imbalance during Cross-Validation**:
   - If you're using **cross-validation**, ensure to stratify your splits so that each fold has the same proportion of the classes as the full dataset.
     ```python
     from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold

     skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5)
     for train_index, val_index in skf.split(X, y):
         X_train, X_val = X[train_index], X[val_index]
         y_train, y_val = y[train_index], y[val_index]
     ```

This should help address the **class imbalance** during training without needing to sample your data (since you're handling it with loss adjustments and evaluation metrics). Let me know if you need further clarification on any of these points!
