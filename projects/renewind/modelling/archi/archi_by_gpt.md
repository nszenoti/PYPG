Here are six different neural network architectures, ranging from simple to complex, for your binary classification problem. Each one introduces different techniques or combinations of methods aimed at improving model performance.

### 1. **Simple Architecture (Baseline Model)**
**Structure**:
- 1 hidden layer, 64 neurons
- Activation: ReLU
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss function: Binary Cross-Entropy
- Output layer: Sigmoid

**Key Points**:
- This is your baseline model.
- Simple, with only one hidden layer to start the training.
- Good starting point for comparison, where we only evaluate the performance of the simplest architecture.

### 2. **Simple Model with Dropout**
**Structure**:
- 1 hidden layer, 64 neurons
- Activation: ReLU
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss function: Binary Cross-Entropy
- Output layer: Sigmoid
- Dropout layer: **Dropout rate = 0.2**

**Key Points**:
- Adding **dropout** to the hidden layer helps prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating some neurons during training.
- Dropout rate of 0.2 means 20% of the neurons will be deactivated during training, making the model generalize better.
- Good for preventing overfitting on the training data, especially if you have a smaller dataset.

### 3. **Deep Model (Multiple Hidden Layers)**
**Structure**:
- 3 hidden layers, each with 64 neurons
- Activation: ReLU
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss function: Binary Cross-Entropy
- Output layer: Sigmoid

**Key Points**:
- This model introduces more complexity by adding additional hidden layers.
- With 3 hidden layers, the model has more capacity to learn non-linear relationships, which can improve performance for more complex data.
- A good architecture to test for improvement, but may lead to overfitting if not regularized.

### 4. **Model with SGD Optimizer (Specific Requirement)**
**Structure**:
- 2 hidden layers, 128 neurons each
- Activation: ReLU
- Optimizer: **SGD** (Stochastic Gradient Descent) with learning rate decay
- Loss function: Binary Cross-Entropy
- Output layer: Sigmoid
- Dropout layer: Dropout rate = 0.2

**Key Points**:
- This model uses the **SGD optimizer**, as requested, to demonstrate its performance.
- A learning rate decay is often used with SGD to improve convergence.
- The model also incorporates **dropout** to prevent overfitting.
- **SGD** can have slower convergence than Adam, but with careful tuning, it can be competitive.

### 5. **Model with Class Weights (Handling Imbalanced Dataset)**
**Structure**:
- 2 hidden layers, 128 neurons each
- Activation: ReLU
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss function: Binary Cross-Entropy
- Output layer: Sigmoid
- Dropout layer: Dropout rate = 0.3

**Key Points**:
- This model uses **class weights** to handle imbalanced target classes, where the "failure" class is much less frequent than the "no failure" class.
- The **dropout rate** is increased to 0.3, as a more complex model with more neurons and class weights might need stronger regularization.
- Class weights are used to give more importance to the minority class ("failure") in training.

### 6. **Complex Model with Multiple Hidden Layers and Optimizers**
**Structure**:
- 3 hidden layers, 256 neurons each
- Activation: ReLU
- Optimizer: **Adam**
- Loss function: Binary Cross-Entropy
- Output layer: Sigmoid
- Dropout: Dropout rate = 0.5
- Batch normalization: After each hidden layer

**Key Points**:
- A more complex architecture with 3 hidden layers and 256 neurons in each.
- **Batch normalization** is added to improve training stability and help with convergence.
- **Dropout** is higher at 0.5, which is often used in deep networks to prevent overfitting.
- A more powerful architecture, but at the cost of higher computation and potential overfitting.

---

### 7. **Complex Model with SGD Optimizer and Regularization**
**Structure**:
- 3 hidden layers, 128 neurons each
- Activation: LeakyReLU
- Optimizer: **SGD**
- Loss function: Binary Cross-Entropy
- Output layer: Sigmoid
- Dropout: Dropout rate = 0.4
- L2 Regularization: Add L2 regularization to weights (lambda = 0.01)

**Key Points**:
- This architecture uses **SGD optimizer** (as requested) with LeakyReLU for activation in hidden layers.
- Includes **L2 regularization** to prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights.
- The dropout rate is kept high (0.4), and the architecture uses a higher number of neurons for more capacity.

### Key Model Performance Considerations:
- **Model 1 (Baseline)**: Likely to perform as expected, with potential room for improvement using more layers or regularization techniques.
- **Model 2 (Dropout)**: Will likely generalize better than the baseline due to regularization (dropout).
- **Model 3 (Deep Model)**: Can improve performance on complex data but needs careful tuning to avoid overfitting.
- **Model 4 (SGD)**: Will showcase the behavior of SGD as an optimizer, which can often have slower convergence than Adam.
- **Model 5 (Class Weights)**: Should perform better if the dataset is imbalanced, giving more importance to the minority class.
- **Model 6 (Complex Model)**: Likely to achieve better performance on complex tasks but at the risk of overfitting.
- **Model 7 (SGD + Regularization)**: Shows how SGD and regularization (L2) can help the model converge while avoiding overfitting.

### Conclusion:
- Start with a **simple architecture** and then incrementally build complexity.
- Introduce dropout, class weights, and different optimizers to improve generalization and performance.
- Evaluate each modelâ€™s performance on a validation set and select the best-performing model based on accuracy and generalization.
