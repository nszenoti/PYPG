For your wind turbine failure prediction problem, monitoring `val_f2_score` is generally better than `val_recall` for early stopping, though it's a nuanced choice:

**Why val_f2_score is preferred:**

1. **Balanced optimization** - F2 still heavily weights recall (4x more than precision) but prevents the model from making excessive false positives

2. **Business reality** - While missing failures is costly, too many false alarms would eventually undermine trust in the system and increase unnecessary maintenance costs

3. **Generalization** - Models that optimize purely for recall might achieve 100% recall by predicting everything as "failure," which wouldn't generalize well

4. **Practical deployment** - A model with reasonable precision alongside high recall will be more useful in production

**When val_recall might be better:**
- If the cost of a missed failure is astronomically higher than a false alarm
- If you plan to adjust the classification threshold later anyway
- If you have a specific minimum recall target that must be met

For most wind turbine applications, the F2 score provides the right balance - prioritizing recall while still maintaining some consideration for precision.
