Great question!

### 🔹 **Point-Biserial Correlation:**

It's a **special case of Pearson correlation**, used when:

- One variable is **continuous** (e.g. V2, V14, etc.)
- One variable is **binary** (e.g. target: 0 or 1)

So in your case — where you're trying to see how well a **numeric feature relates to the binary target class** — **point-biserial correlation is the right statistical choice**.

### 🔹 **How is it different from normal `corr()` between column and target?**

Normal `corr()` (like `df.corr()`) works but:

| Metric                     | Works with Target? | Type Safety | Good for Classification? |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| `df.corr()` (Pearson)      | ✅ Yes (binary)     | ❌ No        | ⚠️ Okay, but not ideal    |
| Point-Biserial Correlation | ✅ Yes (binary)     | ✅ Yes       | ✅ Yes (recommended)      |

So while Pearson can technically be used, **point-biserial is semantically and statistically more accurate** when one variable is binary.

### 🔹 Interpretation

- Output is from **-1 to +1**
- Closer to +1 or -1 = stronger relationship between feature and class
- Closer to 0 = weak or no relationship

---

### 🔹 How to calculate in Python:

```python
from scipy.stats import pointbiserialr

correlation, p_value = pointbiserialr(df["V2"], df["Target"])
print(f"Point-Biserial Correlation: {correlation}, p-value: {p_value}")
```

Let me know if you want me to calculate it for a column if you give me the data.
