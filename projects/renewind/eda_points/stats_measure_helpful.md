Yes, several statistical measures can quantify relationships between two numeric features and a binary target:

1. **Conditional means/medians** - Calculate mean/median of each feature for each target class
2. **Conditional correlation** - You've already done this (correlation by class)
3. **ANOVA** - Test if feature means differ significantly between classes
4. **Mutual information** - Measures how much knowing one variable reduces uncertainty about others
5. **Point-biserial correlation** - Correlation between each numeric feature and the binary target
6. **Logistic regression coefficients** - How features jointly predict the target probability

If you share these statistics, I can infer patterns in how the features relate to failures.
