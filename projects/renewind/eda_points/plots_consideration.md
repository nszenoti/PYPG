For neural network modeling with binary classification, these plots would be most beneficial:

**Univariate Analysis:**
1. **Histograms/Density plots** - Show feature distributions and potential skewness that might require normalization before feeding to neural networks
2. **Box plots by target class** - Reveal how feature distributions differ between failure/non-failure cases

**Bivariate Analysis:**
1. **Scatter plots of correlated features colored by target** - Show how feature relationships differ between classes
2. **Feature importance plots** (like mutual information) - Identify which features have strongest predictive power for the target

These visualizations will help identify patterns neural networks might leverage and guide preprocessing decisions like normalization and feature selection.
