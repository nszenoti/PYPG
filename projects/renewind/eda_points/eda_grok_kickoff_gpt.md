Perfect â€” letâ€™s **grok it out** before plotting. Given that:

---

### ðŸ“Œ Setup:
- All **numeric columns**
- Binary target: **0 (No Failure)** vs **1 (Failure)**
- Downstream model: **Neural Network (non-linear, scale-sensitive)**

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal of EDA:
- Understand **distribution**, **separation**, **skew**, and **signal** in features
- Identify **outliers**, **missingness**, and potential **feature usefulness**

---

### âœ… Recommended Plot Types:

| Plot                                             | Use For                                                  | Why It's Useful                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Histogram** (per class)                        | Understand distribution of a feature, compare class-wise | Check if feature separates failures from non-failures  |
| **Boxplot** (grouped by class)                   | Outliers & median shift per class                        | Good for identifying shifts and spread between 0 and 1 |
| **KDE Plot** (density per class)                 | Smoothed histogram                                       | Helps see class separation cleanly                     |
| **Scatter Plot** (pair of features + hue=target) | For selected correlated pairs                            | See if 2D space helps separate classes                 |
| **Heatmap of correlation**                       | Feature redundancy                                       | See how tightly features are grouped                   |
| **Missingness barplot**                          | Visualize % of missing values                            | Decide on imputation or other strategy                 |

---

### Bonus:
- **Violin Plot** (for 1D dist. per class) â€“ combo of box + KDE.
- **Pairplot** â€“ if very few features (say 4-6) to visualize clusters.

---

### Neural Net Specific Note:
Even though NN can handle non-linearity, it helps if you **normalize inputs**, detect **dominant signals**, and reduce **noisy or flat features** â€” all of which EDA supports.

Let me know which plot you wanna start with â€” box, KDE, or hist?
