Yes, exactly — that's expected!

The **KDE plot** is like a **contour map of density**, and here's how to interpret it in this context:

---

### 🔍 What you’re seeing:
- Each **contour** represents areas of **higher data density**.
- You’ll see **two sets of contours**, one for each class (`Target = 0` and `1`) — colored differently by the `palette`.
- **Separation or overlap** of these contours tells you how well the two classes differ in that 2D feature space.

---

### ✅ Why it’s useful for you:
- It helps you **visually assess class separability**, crucial for model learning.
- Unlike scatter plots, it doesn't suffer from **overplotting** in large datasets.
- **Ideal when features are numeric** and the target is categorical.

Would you like me to share a quick combo code snippet where we show both KDE **and** scatter side-by-side for better insight?
