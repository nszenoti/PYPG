ðŸ”¥ Awesome question â€” and this is exactly the kind of thoughtful step that separates *exploratory* work from *strategic* feature selection.

### âœ… Short Answer:

> **Yes**, both heatmaps make sense â€” but **for different purposes**.
> Your **goal** will decide **which one to use** and **when**.

### ðŸŽ¯ When to Use Heatmap on **Top 10 Potential Predictors**:

#### Purpose:
- Understand how your *most predictive* features interact with **each other**.
- Check for **multicollinearity** among the strongest candidates.

#### Why Itâ€™s Helpful:
- If many of the top 10 are **strongly correlated with each other**, you may want to **drop or combine** some.
- Keeps your model **lean and non-redundant**.

### ðŸŽ¯ When to Use Heatmap for **Pairs with Correlation > 0.85**:

#### Purpose:
- Identify **redundant features** even if theyâ€™re not top predictors.
- Ideal for **feature pruning** or **dimensionality reduction (like PCA)**.

#### Why Itâ€™s Helpful:
- Prevents you from feeding in **duplicative information** to your model.
- Great for reducing noise and improving generalization.

### âœ… Ideal Workflow:

1. **Do heatmap of full feature set** â†’ Find all highly correlated pairs (e.g., `abs(corr) > 0.85`)
2. **Do heatmap of top predictive features (like your top 10)** â†’ Look for overlap/redundancy
3. **Decide:**
   - If two strong predictors are highly correlated â†’ **keep one**
   - If two weak predictors are highly correlated â†’ **drop both or combine**

---

### ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:

For very correlated top predictors (say `V15` and `V7`, r = 0.86+):
- You might **retain only one**.
- Or combine using PCA or a domain-logic rule.
