For V2, I'd recommend mean imputation since:

1. The distribution is nearly symmetric (skewness â‰ˆ -0.04) and has normal-like kurtosis (0.08)
2. Mean (0.44) and median (0.47) are very close, indicating no significant skew
3. Only 18 missing values out of ~20,000 observations (0.09%), so imputation impact will be minimal

Mean imputation is simple, preserves the distribution's center, and won't introduce bias given these characteristics. For **neural** networks, this approach is reasonable since the feature will be normalized anyway.
