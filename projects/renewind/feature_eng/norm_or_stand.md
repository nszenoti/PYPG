We are going to employ neural network (feed forward)
- binary classification task
- All columns are numeric in nature
- many columns has -ve values

What we should do ?

That’s a great question — let’s clear up the confusion between **normalization** and **standardization**, and why **normalization** is *not preferred* in your case.

---

### 🔍 What’s the difference?

| Technique                              | What it does                              | When to use                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Normalization** (`MinMaxScaler`)     | Rescales data to [0, 1] (or custom range) | Data is **positive-only** and **bounded**, like image pixels                          |
| **Standardization** (`StandardScaler`) | Transforms data to mean = 0, std = 1      | When data has **outliers**, **negative values**, or follows a normal-ish distribution |

---

### ❌ Why **Normalization** is *not ideal* for your case:

1. **Your data contains negative values**
   MinMaxScaler will shift everything into [0, 1] → This can **distort relationships** between features.

2. **Your features are not on the same scale**
   Neural networks can get **stuck** or **slow down** if some inputs dominate others (which happens with raw/normalized data).

3. **Sensitive to outliers**
   Normalization scales based on min and max. If there's even one outlier, it **shrinks the scale** of most other values.

---

### ✅ Why Standardization is better here

- Keeps **distribution shape** (centered at 0, with unit variance)
- Robust when values vary a lot (which they do in your features)
- Ideal for **neural networks**, where symmetric input helps convergence

---

### TL;DR

> ❌ Don’t normalize because:
> - Your data includes negative values
> - Min/Max scaling will compress or distort meaningful variance
> - Neural networks perform better with standardized input (zero mean, unit variance)

So:
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

Want a visual example showing how normalization vs standardization behave on your data?

Also I forget to add most of feature we saw in EDA are showing normal distb (ie Symmetric)


Perfect — that makes **standardization** an even better fit! 🙌

Here’s why:

---

### ✅ When features are **normally distributed (or symmetric)**:

- **StandardScaler** leverages this by centering (mean = 0) and scaling (std = 1), which **preserves the structure** of the distribution.
- Neural networks love this because:
  - Weights can converge faster.
  - The optimizer (like Adam or SGD) behaves more consistently when all features are on the same standardized scale.

---

### ❌ If you were to normalize instead:

- You'd squash all features to [0, 1] (or any range), **destroying symmetry** and making different distributions look similar.
- That reduces the **expressiveness** of features — which is not what we want, especially when symmetry helps separate classes (as you saw in EDA with class-specific means/contours).

---

### So, your updated checklist:

- [x] All features numeric ✅
- [x] Symmetric / bell-shaped distributions ✅
- [x] Suitable for Feedforward Neural Net ✅
- 🔒 Use: **`StandardScaler`** from `sklearn`
