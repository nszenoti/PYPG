Yes, imputing per class would be the best approach for V1. Since there's a significant difference in the distribution between failure and non-failure cases (median of 0.77 vs -0.84), class-conditional imputation will preserve this important signal.

This approach:
1. Maintains the distinct patterns in each class
2. Prevents diluting the predictive power of V1
3. Ensures missing values are filled with values representative of their true class

For neural networks, preserving these class-specific distributions in the input features can help the model learn more effectively.
