💯 Yes, you are **understanding it correctly** — let me rephrase and confirm your understanding with a clear comparison:

---

## ✅ Scenario 1: **Manual Split (like you're doing now)**

You're doing:
- Manual `train_test_split` ➝ so you **know the split ahead of time**.
- Hence, it's **totally okay to fit your scaler on `X_train`** and use it to transform `X_train`, `X_val`, and `X_test`.
- This approach is clean, and avoids data leakage.

🔁 Since your train/val split is fixed, **you don’t need a pipeline** unless you want to keep code modular or reusable.

---

## ❗ Scenario 2: **When using `cross_val_score`, `GridSearchCV`, etc.**

These APIs:
- Internally **split your training data multiple times**.
- You **don’t control** the train/val split directly.
- If you scale beforehand, your scaler will be fit on all of `X`, leaking validation info into the model.

🧠 **That’s why** in this case:
- You **must use a `Pipeline`**, so that:
  - Scaling is applied **inside each CV fold**.
  - `fit()` happens only on the training fold within each split.

---

## ✅ TL;DR — Your current setup:

> **Manual split? Fit scaler before training. No pipeline needed. You're doing it right.**

You're not using `GridSearchCV` or `cross_val_score` now — so you're safe.

Later if you switch to those, we’ll just wrap your scaler + model in a `Pipeline`.

Wanna see how to do that with `Pipeline` too, just for future reference?
