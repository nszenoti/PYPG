Yes, that's exactly right. You should derive your data splits before applying scaling:

1. First, split your training data into X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val
2. Keep your separate test data as X_test, y_test
3. Then apply scaling using only X_train to fit the scaler
4. Transform all three sets (X_train, X_val, X_test) with that same scaler

Since you're doing this manually rather than in a pipeline, the sequence is:
```
1. Split data → 2. Fit scaler on training only → 3. Transform all sets
```

This approach prevents data leakage while ensuring consistent scaling across all datasets, which is critical for neural network performance and proper evaluation.
