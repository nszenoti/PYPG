Yes, using `keras.utils.set_random_seed` and `enable_op_determinism()` is excellent practice, especially for research and production ML workflows.

**Benefits:**

1. **Reproducibility** - You can recreate exact results across runs, which is crucial for:
   - Debugging model behavior
   - Validating improvements
   - Scientific rigor in experiments

2. **Collaboration** - Team members can reproduce each other's results exactly

3. **Production stability** - Ensures consistent behavior when deploying models

4. **Ablation studies** - Properly isolate the impact of specific changes to your model

**Implementation:**

```python
# At the beginning of your notebook/script
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import random

# Set seeds
SEED = 42
tf.keras.utils.set_random_seed(SEED)  # Sets seed for TF, Numpy, and Python
tf.config.experimental.enable_op_determinism()  # Makes TF ops deterministic
```

The only downside is a potential minor performance impact from deterministic operations, but the reproducibility benefits almost always outweigh this cost.

For your wind turbine failure prediction project, I strongly recommend implementing these practices.
