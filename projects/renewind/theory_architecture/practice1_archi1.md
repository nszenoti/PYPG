I apologize for jumping ahead with code modifications. You're absolutely right - we should discuss changes first before implementing them.

Regarding your question about using the same activation for all hidden layers:

**Industry standard practice:**
- Most neural networks do use the same activation function across all hidden layers (typically ReLU)
- Using different activations per layer is less common but can be beneficial in specific cases

**When same activation works well:**
- For standard feedforward networks solving classification problems
- When the data relationships don't require complex transformations
- For most practical applications where simplicity is valued

**When different activations might help:**
- In very deep networks with specific architectural needs
- When combining different types of feature processing
- In specialized networks like autoencoders (where encoder/decoder may use different activations)

For your wind turbine failure prediction task, starting with the same activation for all layers is a good approach. If you want to experiment with different activations later, we can modify the function at that time.

Does this explanation help with your question?
