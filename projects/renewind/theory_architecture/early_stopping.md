For your wind turbine failure prediction use case, early stopping would be beneficial for several reasons:

Theoretically, early stopping helps prevent overfitting, which is particularly important when:
1. Working with imbalanced data (your 96% vs 4% class distribution)
2. Using complex neural networks that can memorize training data
3. Having limited training examples of the minority class

Regarding which metric to monitor:

Monitoring `val_recall` instead of the default `val_loss` makes sense because:
1. Your primary concern is catching failures (minimizing false negatives)
2. Loss functions like binary cross-entropy optimize for overall accuracy, not specifically recall
3. It directly aligns with your business objective (preventing costly failures)

However, there's a trade-off - optimizing purely for recall could lead to excessive false positives. You might consider:
1. Monitoring `val_f2_score` as a balanced approach (still prioritizing recall)
2. Using a custom combined metric that weights recall higher but still considers precision
3. Setting a minimum acceptable precision threshold alongside recall optimization

In practice, I'd recommend trying both approaches (monitoring `val_loss` vs. `val_recall` or `val_f2_score`) and comparing the results on your validation set.

ðŸ’¡ Best Practice
Use validation metrics for early stopping (like 'val_loss', 'val_f1', etc.)
Because training metrics may look great even if your model is overfitting.
