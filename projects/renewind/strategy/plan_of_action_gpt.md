Awesome — thanks for the detailed context and problem statement. You're already thinking in the right direction by wanting to deeply grok the problem before coding. Let’s now **build a high-level, end-to-end plan of attack**, especially keeping in mind your intent to use a **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)** for classification.

---

## 🔭 **Understanding the Problem**

We are predicting **wind turbine generator failures** based on sensor data.

This is a **binary classification** task:
- **Target:** 1 = failure, 0 = no failure
- **Data:** 40 anonymized (ciphered) features → likely continuous/numerical
- **Training set:** 20,000 samples
- **Test set:** 5,000 samples

Failures are rare (likely), so **class imbalance** is an expected issue. Also, **costs of mistakes are asymmetric**:
- **FN (missed failure)** → very bad → expensive replacement
- **FP (false alarm)** → tolerable → inspection cost
- **TP (correctly flagged failure)** → good → repair cost

---

## 📌 Goal

Build and tune a **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)** classifier that:
1. **Minimizes False Negatives** (to avoid missed failures),
2. While **controlling False Positives** (not too many false alarms),
3. And is trained with good deep learning practices.

## 🧠 High-Level Plan of Attack (Step-by-Step)

### 1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**

#### ✅ Tasks:
- Check distribution of the target variable (expected class imbalance).
- Explore distributions of features (ciphered, but still helpful: ranges, scales, skew).
- Check for missing values, outliers (though anonymized, pattern may still show).
- Scale features using **StandardScaler** or **RobustScaler** (important for FNN).

#### 🔍 Why it matters:
- FNNs are sensitive to feature scales.
- Class imbalance must be handled or FN will dominate.

---

### 2. **Designing the Model Architecture**

#### 🏗️ Baseline FNN Architecture:
- Input: 40 features
- Hidden Layers: Start with 2–3 layers (e.g. 64 → 32 → 16) with ReLU
- Output: 1 neuron with **Sigmoid activation**

#### 🧪 Architecture Options to Experiment:
- Wider networks (more neurons/layer)
- Deeper networks (more layers)
- Try architectures like: 128-64-32, 64-64, etc.
- Use **Batch Normalization** after dense layers
- Apply **Dropout** (start with 0.2–0.5)

#### 🧠 Why this helps:
- Deeper nets may help capture complex patterns, even if ciphered.
- Dropout and BN help regularize and speed up training.

---

### 3. **Loss Function & Metrics**

#### 📉 Loss Function:
- Use **Binary Crossentropy** (standard for binary classification)
- Consider **Weighted Binary Crossentropy** to penalize FN more than FP

#### 📊 Metrics:
- **Recall** (very important, to minimize FN)
- **Precision** (to keep FP low)
- **F1-score** (balance of precision and recall)
- **AUC-ROC** (ability to separate classes across thresholds)

#### 🧠 Why:
- Accuracy is misleading with imbalanced data
- We care more about detecting failures (even at cost of some false alarms)

---

### 4. **Handling Class Imbalance**

#### ⚖️ Options:
- Compute **class weights** dynamically (e.g. via `sklearn.utils.class_weight`)
- Use **over/undersampling** techniques (SMOTE, RandomOverSampler)
- Try **focal loss** (alternative to BCE, focuses on hard examples)

#### 🧠 Why:
- Without this, model might always predict “no failure” due to imbalance

---

### 5. **Regularization & Initialization**

#### 🎯 Techniques:
- Use **He initialization** (for ReLU-based layers)
- Add **Dropout** to reduce overfitting
- Use **L2 regularization** if overfitting persists

---

### 6. **Optimizer & Training Setup**

#### ⚙️ Optimizers:
- Start with **Adam** (fast convergence, good defaults)
- Experiment with **SGD + Momentum** for stability

#### 🧪 Learning Rate:
- Use **learning rate scheduler** (ReduceLROnPlateau)
- Optionally try **cyclical learning rates**

#### 🔁 Epochs & Batch Size:
- Batch Size: 32 or 64
- Epochs: Start with 50–100 with **early stopping**

---

### 7. **Validation Strategy**

#### 🔁 Use:
- **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation** (preserve imbalance in each fold)
- Or Train/Val split (e.g. 80-20) with stratified split

---

### 8. **Model Evaluation**

#### ✅ Evaluate on:
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Precision, Recall, F1**
- **AUC-ROC**
- **Cost-Based Custom Metric**: simulate real-world cost (e.g. assign weights: FN = 1000, TP = 100, FP = 10)

---

### 9. **Final Testing & Reporting**

- Evaluate the best tuned model on the **test set (unseen)**.
- Report all relevant metrics.
- Optionally calibrate threshold using precision-recall curve to optimize for recall vs precision tradeoff.

---

### 10. **Optional: Model Interpretability**

Even though features are ciphered:
- Try **permutation importance** or **SHAP** to check which features matter most.
