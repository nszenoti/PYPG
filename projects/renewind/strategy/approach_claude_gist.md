I've locked in the strategic approach for the wind turbine failure prediction model. The key elements include:

- A neural network with 2-3 hidden layers, decreasing in width
- Mini-batch gradient descent with Adam optimizer
- Binary cross-entropy loss with class weighting to penalize false negatives more heavily
- Regularization via dropout and batch normalization
- Handling class imbalance through class weights or sampling techniques
- Focusing on F2-score as our primary metric given the cost structure
- Threshold adjustment based on the business cost considerations

I'm ready to proceed with this approach as we move forward with implementation. Let me know what you'd like to work on next!
