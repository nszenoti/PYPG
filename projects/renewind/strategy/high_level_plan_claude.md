I'd be happy to help you develop a high-level strategy for your neural network approach to the wind turbine failure prediction problem. Let's think through the key considerations before diving into code.

# Strategic Approach for Wind Turbine Failure Prediction

## Problem Understanding
This is a binary classification problem where we need to predict wind turbine generator failures. The cost structure is important:
- Repair costs (true positives) < Replacement costs (false negatives)
- Inspection costs (false positives) < Repair costs (true positives)

This suggests we should prioritize minimizing false negatives, even at the expense of some false positives.

## Data Considerations
- 40 predictors, likely sensor readings
- 20,000 training observations, 5,000 test observations
- Potential class imbalance (failures are typically rare events)

## Neural Network Strategy

### Architecture Design
- **Input Layer**: 40 nodes (one for each predictor)
- **Hidden Layers**:
  - Start with 2-3 hidden layers (moderate depth)
  - First layer wider (e.g., 128 or 256 nodes) to capture complex patterns
  - Subsequent layers with decreasing width (e.g., 128 → 64 → 32)
  - ReLU activation for hidden layers (handles non-linearity well without vanishing gradient issues)
- **Output Layer**: Single node with sigmoid activation (for binary classification)

### Training Approach
- **Batch Size**: Mini-batch gradient descent (e.g., 32-128) rather than vanilla GD for better convergence
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer (adaptive learning rates, momentum)
- **Learning Rate**: Start with 0.001, implement learning rate scheduling if needed
- **Epochs**: Use early stopping with patience to prevent overfitting

### Loss Function
- **Binary Cross-Entropy**: Standard for binary classification
- **Weighted Loss**: Given the cost structure, we should consider weighting the loss function to penalize false negatives more heavily than false positives

### Regularization Techniques
- **Dropout**: Apply between hidden layers (e.g., 0.2-0.3) to prevent overfitting
- **Batch Normalization**: After activation functions to stabilize learning
- **L2 Regularization**: Small weight decay to prevent large weights

### Handling Class Imbalance
- **Class Weights**: Adjust class weights inversely proportional to class frequencies
- **Oversampling/Undersampling**: Consider SMOTE for synthetic minority samples if imbalance is severe
- **Threshold Adjustment**: Adjust decision threshold based on cost considerations

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Primary Metric**: Given the cost structure, F2-score might be appropriate (weighs recall higher than precision)
- **Secondary Metrics**:
  - AUC-ROC for overall discriminative ability
  - Precision-Recall curve (more informative than ROC for imbalanced data)
  - Confusion matrix for detailed error analysis
  - Cost-based metric that incorporates the specific costs of FP, FN, and TP

### Model Tuning
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Grid search or random search for key parameters
- **Cross-Validation**: K-fold CV to ensure robust performance

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this strategy or shall we move forward with implementing this approach?
