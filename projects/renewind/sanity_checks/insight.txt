I understand. I've noted the insights about the sanity checks:

- No outliers among the predictors (at least not above the 5% threshold)
- Some feature pairs show correlation at 0.8 threshold, but none at 0.9 threshold, indicating no extremely strong correlations

I won't reply further until you provide additional instructions.
