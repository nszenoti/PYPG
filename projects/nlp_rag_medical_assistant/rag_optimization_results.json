Nothing is given by mouth, and the patient's head is turned to one side to avoid aspiration if emesis occurs. Treatment begins simultaneously with evaluation. Supplemental O2 by face mask is provided. If shock is severe or if ventilation is inadequate, airway intubation with mechanical ventilation is necessary. Two large (16- to 18-gauge) IV catheters are inserted into separate peripheral veins. A central venous line or an intraosseous needle, especially in children, provides an alternative when peripheral veins cannot promptly be accessed (see also p. 2250)."

Antibiotic therapy unless septic foci are eliminated. Normalization of blood glucose improves outcome in critically ill patients, even those not known to be diabetic. A continuous IV insulin infusion (crystalline zinc 1 to 4 U/h) is titrated to maintain glucose between 80 to 110 mg/dL (4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L). This approach necessitates frequent (eg, q 1 to 4 h) glucose measurement. Corticosteroid therapy seems beneficial. Treatment is with replacement doses rather than pharmacologic doses. One regimen consists of hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q 6 h (or 100 mg q 8 h) plus fludrocortisone 50 \u03bcg po once/day during hemodynamic instability and for 3 days thereafter. Activated protein C (drotrecogin alfa), a recombinant drug with fibrinolytic and anti-inflammatory activity, seems beneficial for severe sepsis and septic shock if it is begun early; benefit has been shown only in patients with significant risk of death as defined by an APACHE II score of > 25 (see Table 222-4 on p. 2248). Dosage is 24 \u03bcg/kg/h by continuous IV infusion for 96 h. Bleeding is the most common complication; thus, contraindications include hemorrhagic stroke within 3 mo, spinal or intracranial surgery within 2 mo, acute trauma with a risk of bleeding, and intracranial neoplasm. Risk-benefit assessment is required in other patients with increased risk of serious bleeding (eg, with thrombocytopenia or recent GI bleeding, receiving concurrent heparin, or with recent aspirin or other anticoagulant use). Other emerging therapies for severe sepsis include cooling for hyperthermia and early treatment of renal failure (eg, with continuous venovenous hemofiltration). Trials of monoclonal antibodies to the lipid A fraction of endotoxin, antileukotrienes, and antibodies to tumor necrosis factor have been unsuccessful."

Lichen planopilaris and chronic cutaneous lupus lesions may be treated with oral antimalarials, corticosteroids, retinoids, or immunosuppressants. Hair loss due to chemotherapy is temporary and is best treated with a wig; when hair regrows, it may be different in color and texture from the original hair. Hair loss due to telogen effluvium or anagen effluvium is usually temporary as well and abates after the precipitating agent is eliminated.
