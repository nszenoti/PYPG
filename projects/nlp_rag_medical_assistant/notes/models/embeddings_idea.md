You're right. The Amazon Titan Embedding model has a newer version, `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`, which offers more flexibility with different embedding dimensions.

The `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0` model supports:
- 1024 dimensions (default)
- 516 dimensions (smaller option)

Using the smaller 516-dimensional embeddings would reduce storage requirements and potentially improve search speed while still maintaining good semantic representation for medical text. This could be a good option if you're concerned about performance.

To use this model with a specific dimension, you would modify the embedding initialization like this:

```python
from langchain_aws import BedrockEmbeddings

# Initialize the Titan Embeddings v2 model with 516 dimensions
embeddings = BedrockEmbeddings(
    client=bedrock_client,
    model_id="amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0",
    model_kwargs={"dimensions": 516}  # Specify 516 dimensions
)
```

For the RAG application, the 516-dimensional embeddings should still provide good retrieval quality while being more efficient than the 1,536-dimensional embeddings from v1.
