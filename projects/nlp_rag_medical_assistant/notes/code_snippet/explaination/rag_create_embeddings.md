Your function `create_embeddings_with_checkpoints` is logically sound and quite well-structured. It handles batching, checkpointing, and graceful failure recovery effectively. Here's a detailed review of its logic, along with suggestions for minor improvements:

---

### ✅ **What’s Good / Correct**

1. **Checkpointing Works**:

   * It resumes from where it left off (`start_idx`) using a pickle file—correct and practical for long processes.

2. **Efficient Batching**:

   * Uses `batch_size` to process in manageable chunks—saves memory and avoids API overload.

3. **Metadata Tracking**:

   * It keeps `metadatas` and `texts` in sync with chunks from the beginning, which simplifies the final output.

4. **Safe Fallbacks**:

   * If the checkpoint fails to load, it starts from scratch—failsafe.

5. **Embedding Model Initialization**:

   * `BedrockEmbeddings` is instantiated early with required params—clear and reusable.

### 🛠️ **Suggested Improvements**

#### 1. **Embeddings Mismatch Bug (Potential)**

* If the process is restarted, `texts` and `metadatas` are *not truncated* to align with the resumed `start_idx`, which can cause **length mismatches** downstream.

```python
if start_idx > 0:
    texts = texts[start_idx:]
    metadatas = metadatas[start_idx:]
```

Or alternatively:

```python
embeddings = checkpoint_data['embeddings']
texts = texts[:start_idx]
metadatas = metadatas[:start_idx]
```

But you need to ensure that the **output lists are aligned** in length and order.

#### 2. **Atomic Checkpointing**

* Writing to the checkpoint file directly can corrupt it if interrupted mid-write. Consider writing to a temp file and renaming it:

```python
with open(checkpoint_file + '.tmp', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump({...}, f)
os.replace(checkpoint_file + '.tmp', checkpoint_file)
```

#### 3. **Configurable Sleep**

* Let `sleep_time` be a function arg (default to 0.1s). More flexible and testable.

#### 4. **Error Logging**

* Use `logging` instead of `print` for better integration with production environments.

#### 5. **Type Hinting**

* Add more type hints to improve readability and IDE support:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def create_embeddings_with_checkpoints(
    chunks: List[Document],
    batch_size: int = BATCH_SIZE,
    checkpoint_file: str = CHECKPOINT_FILE
) -> Tuple[List[str], List[List[float]], List[dict]]:
```

---

### 💡 Optional Enhancements

* Add a `resume: bool = True` flag to skip loading checkpoints if desired.
* Add validation to ensure embedding dimensions and batch size are compatible with model limits.
* Report estimated time remaining in progress bar with `tqdm`.

Would you like me to suggest a slightly revised version of this function incorporating the above fixes?
