This code correctly sets up a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. Let me explain what it does:

```python:rag_pipeline.py
def setup_rag_pipeline(vector_store, llm):
    """Set up a RAG pipeline with the vector store and LLM."""
    # Create retriever
    retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(
        search_type="similarity",
        search_kwargs={"k": 5}
    )

    # ... existing code ...
```

## What This RAG Pipeline Does

1. **Creates a Retriever**:
   - Takes your vector store (where your embedded Merck Manual chunks are stored)
   - Configures it to retrieve the 5 most similar chunks to the query using vector similarity search

2. **Defines a RAG Prompt Template**:
   - Creates a template that instructs the model to use the retrieved context
   - Formats the prompt with placeholders for context and question
   - Includes instructions to fall back to general knowledge if needed

3. **Builds a Chain**:
   - Uses LangChain's LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) to create a processing pipeline
   - Passes the user question directly through (`RunnablePassthrough()`)
   - Retrieves relevant context from the vector store
   - Combines context and question into the prompt template
   - Sends the formatted prompt to the LLM
   - Parses the output as a string

This is a standard and effective RAG pipeline setup. The key components are all present:
- Retrieval mechanism (vector similarity search)
- Context integration (prompt template)
- Generation with context (LLM)

The `k=5` parameter means it will retrieve 5 chunks from your vector store, which is a reasonable starting point for medical information that might require multiple perspectives or sections.

This pipeline will effectively use the embedded Merck Manual content to ground the LLM's responses in authoritative medical information.
