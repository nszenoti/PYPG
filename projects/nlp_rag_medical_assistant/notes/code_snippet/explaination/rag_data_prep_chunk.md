Yes — your overall steps and implementation are **correct and valid** for preparing PDF data for a RAG pipeline. Here’s a quick line-by-line validation:

---

### ✅ `extract_text_from_pdf`

```python
def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path: str) -> str:
    reader = PdfReader(pdf_path)
    text = ""
    for page in tqdm(reader.pages, desc="Extracting PDF text"):
        text += page.extract_text() + "\n"
    return text
```

* ✅ `PdfReader` from `PyPDF2` or `pypdf` is commonly used — fine.
* ✅ `.extract_text()` works per page — correct.
* ✅ `tqdm` progress bar — good for tracking.
* ⚠️ Minor: `page.extract_text()` can return `None` → safe version:

```python
text += (page.extract_text() or "") + "\n"
```

---

### ✅ `split_text`

```python
def split_text(text: str) -> List[Document]:
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
        chunk_size=1000,
        chunk_overlap=200,
        separators=["\n\n", "\n", ". ", " ", ""],
        length_function=len
    )

    chunks = text_splitter.create_documents([text])

    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
        chunk.metadata = {
            "chunk_id": i,
            "source": "Merck Manual",
        }

    return chunks
```

* ✅ `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` — correct usage.
* ✅ `create_documents([text])` — valid (LangChain expects a list).
* ✅ Adding `chunk_id` and `source` as metadata — good practice.
* ✅ `separators` include progressively smaller units — proper for `Recursive`.

---

### ✅ Execution

```python
pdf_path = "merck_manual.pdf"
raw_text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)
print(f"Extracted {len(raw_text)} characters from PDF")

chunks = split_text(raw_text)
print(f"Created {len(chunks)} text chunks")
```

* ✅ Extraction and splitting are done sequentially.
* ✅ Logs are helpful and accurate.

### 🔚 Verdict: **Everything is correctly implemented.**

Let me know if you’d like help with the next step (e.g., generating embeddings and storing in FAISS, Chroma, or other vector DBs).
