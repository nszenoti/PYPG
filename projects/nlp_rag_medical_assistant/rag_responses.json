  "Question 1": {
    "question": "What is the protocol for managing sepsis in a critical care unit?",
    "response": " Fluid resuscitation with 0.9% saline should be given until CVP reaches 8 mm Hg (10 cm H2O) or PAOP reaches 12 to 15 mm Hg. Oliguria with hypotension is not a contraindication to vigorous fluid resuscitation. The quantity of fluid required often far exceeds the normal blood volume and may reach 10 to 20 liters per day. Antibiotic therapy unless septic foci are eliminated. Normalization of blood glucose improves outcome in critically ill patients, even those not known to be diabetic. A continuous IV insulin infusion (crystalline zinc 1 to 4 U/h) is titrated to maintain glucose between 80 to 110 mg/dL (4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L). This approach necessitates frequent (eg, q 1 to 4 h) glucose measurement. Corticosteroid therapy seems beneficial. Treatment is with replacement doses rather than pharmacologic doses. One regimen consists of hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q 6 h (or 100 mg q 8 h) plus fludrocortisone 50 \u03bcg po once/day during hemodynamic instability and for 3 days thereafter. Activated protein C (drotrecogin alfa), a recombinant drug with fibrinolytic and anti-inflammatory activity, seems beneficial for severe sepsis and septic shock if it is begun early; benefit has been shown only in patients with significant risk of death as defined by an APACHE II score of > 25 (see Table 222-4 on p. 2248). Dosage is 24 \u03bcg/kg/h by continuous IV infusion for 96 h. Bleeding is the most common complication; thus, contraindications include hemorrhagic stroke within 3 mo, spinal or intracranial surgery within 2 mo, acute trauma with a risk of bleeding, and intracranial neoplasm. Risk-benefit assessment is required in other patients with increased risk of serious bleeding (eg, with thrombocytopenia or recent GI bleeding, receiving concurrent heparin, or with recent aspirin or other anticoagulant use). Other emerging therapies for severe sepsis include cooling for hyperthermia and early treatment of renal failure (eg, with continuous venovenous hemofiltration). Trials of monoclonal antibodies to the lipid A fraction of endotoxin, antileukotrienes, and antibodies to tumor necrosis factor have been unsuccessful."

  "Question 2": {
    "question": "What are the common symptoms of appendicitis, and can it be cured via medicine? If not, what surgical procedure should be followed to treat it?",
    "response": " Common symptoms of appendicitis include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and low-grade fever. While appendicitis can be cured via medicine, it is a surgical condition that requires surgical removal."

  "Question 3": {
    "question": "What are the effective treatments or solutions for addressing sudden patchy hair loss, commonly seen as localized bald spots on the scalp, and what could be the possible causes behind it?",
    "response": " The effective treatments or solutions for addressing sudden patchy hair loss, commonly seen as localized bald spots on the scalp, and what could be the possible causes behind it are:\n    - Androgenetic alopecia (male-pattern or female-pattern hair loss)\n    - Alopecia areata\n    - Trichotillomania\n    - Tinea capitis\n    - Traction alopecia\n    - Scalp symptoms (itching, burning, tingling)\n    - Microscopic hair examination or scalp biopsy for definitive diagnosis\n    - Evaluation for causative disorders (endocrinologic, autoimmune, toxic)\n    - History of present illness\n    - Review of systems\n    - Typical hair care practices\n    - Exposure to noxious stimuli and stressors\n    - Fatigue and cold intolerance (hypothyroidism)\n    - Hirsutism\n    - Deepening of the voice in women\n    - Drugs (including chemotherapeutic agents)\n    - Infection\n    - Autoimmune disease\n    - Heavy metal poisoning\n    - Rare dermatologic conditions"

  "Question 4": {
    "question": "What treatments are recommended for a person who has sustained a physical injury to brain tissue, resulting in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function?",
    "response": " The cornerstone of management for all patients is maintenance of adequate ventilation, oxygenation, and brain perfusion to avoid secondary brain insult. Aggressive early management of hypoxia, hypercapnia, and hypotension is recommended."

  "Question 5": {
    "question": "What are the necessary precautions and treatment steps for a person who has fractured their leg during a hiking trip, and what should be considered for their care and recovery?",
    "response": " The necessary precautions and treatment steps for a person who has fractured their leg during a hiking trip, and what should be considered for their care and recovery are as follows:\n- Restriction of weight-bearing activity\n- Use of crutches\n- Cessation of weight bearing on the involved foot (in case patients have a metatarsal stress fracture)\n- Use of a wooden shoe or other commercially available supportive shoe or boot\n- Healing can take anywhere from 6 to 12 wk."
