# 📒 Data Analysis Notebook: [Dataset Name]

This notebook provides an in-depth analysis of the dataset **[Dataset Name]** and explores insights through various observations, points, and visualizations.

---

## ⚡ Note
- The data used in this analysis comes from **[Source]**.
- The dataset contains columns like `Feature X`, `Feature Y`, and `Target`.

---

## 🔍 **_Observation_**
- **Observation 1**: We see a strong positive correlation between `Feature X` and `Target`.
- **Observation 2**: The data has many missing values in `Feature Y`.

---

## 📌 Points
- **Point 1**: Impute missing values using the mean strategy.
- **Point 2**: Remove outliers in `Feature X` before building predictive models.

---

## 🔧 **_Actionable Insights_**
1. Impute the missing values in `Feature Y` to prevent data loss.
2. Handle outliers by using **interquartile range (IQR)** methods.
3. Feature engineering might be needed to improve model performance.
